32	Apr 30, 2019	3	ai-for-everyone	Very good coursePostitive:Clear commentary and methods of communication (visual, audio, etc)Good pace for something relaxingEasy to understand subject matter explained in a respectful wayNegative:Locked quizzesSome minor UI bugs when switching tracks, the checkmark doesn't activate. Also, the scrolling on page should keep video anchored, while speech-to-text scrolls.Suggestions:Unlock quizzes. People aren't going to pay $ for quizzes, but it helps in feeling satisfied. Locking them makes it feel like an attempt to get money, which makes sense if someone wants the Certificate, but not for quizzes. For example, should a school textbook (being borrowed from the library, perhaps) eliminate practice lessons with answers, and only provide quizzes if the book were used in a paid, formal educational setting?If the goal is to monetize the course, then it makes sense. In that case, thank you for providing the content for free. I found it valuable and interesting.

33	May 10, 2019	3	ai-for-everyone	The course is a high-level overview of the field of AI and data science. While it is to be expected that in an overview course one would cover many issues at a general and non-technical level, I think the course could benefit from being shortened to one or two weeks and focused more on the technical aspects,, such as, for example, the various applications of AI/machine learning and what the state-of-the-art is in the field. Much of what last week's videos focused on would be better left to economists who specifically study these issues (e.g., productivity, impact on jobs and developing countries, etc). Andrew is clearly an authority on AI, but that does not make him an authority on economics. Overall, I though the overview was useful, but I would shorten the course and exploit the instructor's comparative advantage in understanding the technical aspects.

34	Apr 23, 2020	3	ai-for-everyone	Clearly structures course. Touching base on several aspects off AI. Easy to follow and comprehend over duration of the course. Liked the tone, speed and clear articulate way of presenting by the instructor. Would say that this is entry level for anyone wanting to learn about what AI is and what it can/cannot do. Examples of AI systems in practice are somewhat abstract or simple. It would have been nice to see more complicated real life examples of used AI or better said ML systems. A lot can also be learned or taken up by reading current papers by leading companies.	Clearly structures course. Touching base on several aspects off AI.

35	Jul 04, 2020	3	ai-for-everyone	I really esteem this course. Dr Andrew Ng is a pleasure to learn from because he is very knowledgeable, experienced and talks in a calm and respectful voice. The course material is structural in a very clear and easy to access manner with many short videos that makes it excellent for home learning. I would have preferred more practical tasks and more hard core technical facts, rather than a generalised and soft introduction to AI. I highly recommend this course. 	I really esteem this course.

138	Mar 05, 2019	4	ai-for-everyone	The course is a solid high level introduction to the concepts of artificial intelligence, machine learning, data science, and mentions (in passing) some deeper concepts like natural language processing and knowledge graphs.  I enjoyed it!  My critical feedback revolves around the final week: I appreciated the attention given to ethics in AI, but it seems worth mentioning that efforts to eliminate bias and prejudice are themselves inherently based on judgement calls, and will reflect the value(s) of the person(s) making those judgements.  Since this course is aimed at business leaders, I suggest adding some verbiage to the need for an enterprise to articulate those values in a manner that supports their inclusion (at an engineering level) into the techniques, data, and algorithms being developed by those AI teams.

Since this course is aimed at business leaders, I suggest adding some verbiage to the need for an enterprise to articulate those values in a manner that supports their inclusion (at an engineering level) into the techniques, data, and algorithms being developed by those AI teams.

139	Sep 21, 2020	4	ai-for-everyone	This course was a highly informative, non-technical course as to generally what A.I. is, what it can or can't do, understanding it's particular vulnerabilities, how to start introducing A.I. methodologies into a company, its potential value both economic and societal, as well as a look at the potential impacts on society and solutions. It is a very very good primer on understanding the subject if you have no clue as to what AI is. Some statements in the course do seem just a tad little dismissive in terms of the potential impacts of implementation, but other than this the course was fine. I would recommend.

140	Mar 15, 2019	4	ai-for-everyone	I love Andrew Ng's teaching style and his simple presentation of materials such that the average person can understand how AI will impact the world and global economy. I've taken his Machine Learning course for practitioners which is much more technical and goes into full depth.  The only reason I wouldn't rate this as a 5-star is because there seems to be a business angle to the course in the sense that it's a pitch to companies looking to utilize Landing AI's services.   Would recommend this to anyone looking to learn a bit more about AI and how it'll impact their lives.

141	Nov 25, 2019	4	ai-for-everyone	The course applies cognitivistic ideas of learning with frontal learning (videos) and quizzes (memorization) which is only as good as a scaffold to getting real knowledge (building mental models by applying them to the world and getting feedback on the usage). It could easily be improved by having learners write articles where they apply the material to their current situation and have it peer reviewed by other learners (use and refine mental models). Moderators would have to check for mistakes, but it stays more or less scalable.Still good material, though.

The analogies used were interesting and applicable to real world problems and the teacher had a nice sounding passive voice that made the experience a lot better to take in. The only complaint I have is that the video audio is relatively softer compared to everything else in the background so I had to turn it up, but other than that I would highly recommend this course to anyone who is looking forward to learning the basics of AI.	the way the course was conducted was precise and had examples to back up the different topics that was discussed.

144	May 14, 2019	4	ai-for-everyone	This is quite an informative course on what is AI, what it's capable of currently, and how you can launch AI projects in your own organisation.  Andrew Ng goes one step one further and talks about AI and it's role in societies and ethics. Though since it's just information, learners are not assigned any project-type assignment which makes it easy to forget. I managed to score almost 100% in all the quizzes because I make detailed notes but I still doubt I'd be able to retain the info if I don't get an opportunity soon to apply what I learned.

What they can do is buy the software and consulting services for AI, data science, and machine learning.  It would be nice to see coverage of how small and medium businesses can use AI.  Consider TurboTax, which is a popular software developed by software engineers but used by many small tax accounting businesses that cannot afford to individually hire a full time software engineer.

I also recommend the AI primer on YouTube to get some more insights into AI. Together you have a fuller picture of this new and exciting field. Good luck!

excellent. And explained beautifully and I understand that it is to sweep the

to be under full control of UN and respective government so that fruits of the
Technology can be beneficial to humankind all over the world. BBC documentary on world war II delineates destruction of
humanity by people whose consciousness level could not be elevated. Nobody
knows who is the enemy of the other side. Rishi Aurobindo who was the spiritual
exponent died on 05 Dec, 1950 in his life-time was deeply meditating over the reason
of the absence of compassion in some segment of the mankind. As theorized and practiced
by Rishi Aurobindo - that consciousness level can be raised from inert matters and
sees elevation to plant, animals, mankind and ultimately God through invoking
of all-pervading divine forces and power. This principle if can be propagated
to large mass of people will do good for the world along with evolution of AI."	"The lecture for AI course as delivered by Mr Andrew was

1004	Jun 14, 2020	5	ai-for-everyone	  This course gave me an abstract view of AI as well as a realistic view of AI i.e. a high level sense of what AI can and can not do.  So, for someone who is first trying to understand what is AI all about, what are the key tools of AI i.e. Machine Learning including Deep Learning and Data Science, this course provides a right perspective. It also mentions good case studies about complex AI products as well as the roles and responsibilities of large AI teams. AI transformation playbook will be really helpful for companies to get the feel of AI and strategies it for the right future of AI in their company. Finally there is a good perspective on how AI can impact society and how we can navigate the rise of AI in future. The course finally teaches us to keep learning to build knowledge.  Great foundational course and very well narrated by professor Andrew Ng.

Dito isso, o curso foi bastante válido como um primeiro passo para entender o que é IA e, principalmente, o que preciso levar em consideração quando penso em ""criar"" uma aplicação em IA ou quando uma empresa pensa em fazer algo assim. Consegui caminhar os primeiros passos neste entendimento. O que seria importante como sugestão é uma continuação do curso, dando dicas do que devemos buscar conforme nossos objetivos e grau de conhecimento. Em resumo, não posso opinar sobre a qualidade do curso para quem já tem um background no assunto. Mas para as pessoas que, como eu, não tem conhecimento nem formação técnica, o curso é valido.

That said, the course was very valid as a first step towards understanding what AI is and, mainly, what I need to take into account when I think about ""creating"" an application in AI or when a company thinks about doing something like that. I managed to walk the first steps in this understanding. What would be important as a suggestion is a continuation of the course, giving tips on what we should look for according to our objectives and degree of knowledge. In summary, I cannot comment on the quality of the course for someone who already has a background in the subject.

Andrew Ng provided a complete picture of how AI can be practically implemented for the betterment of society. I would like to suggest if some practical videos of AI applications could be added like how Alexa, siri are being used. As being a national of developing country Pakistan where technology is not very common. These devices are very expensive and are not frequently used, so a exposure is required. And another suggestion concept in case studies in which step expertise of software engineer, Machine learning engineer are required need to be emphasized. What kind of hardware support is required need to be discussed for the development of application Otherwise it was perfect. Thanks Andrerw Ng.

1009	Jun 29, 2019	5	ai-for-everyone	This course helped learn the difference between a Data Science and ML project and build an intuition of how I can apply this iin my context. For example, data science can help derive insights about user behavior in consuming learning content. For this I learned that gathering data from various sources and connecting the patterns in the data set, is what data can help. Once I have this then maybe I can build a ML to make recommendations at the right time at the right place users to pick a new skill or a new trend. This means if I can learn about Data Science tools, ML and synthesize it with my design, user experience, I can operate at the intersection of the two and future proof my skills. Thank you for building this course.	This course helped learn the difference between a Data Science and ML project and build an intuition of how I can apply this iin my context.

1028	Sep 14, 2020	5	ai-for-everyone	Very informative course. I had started off this course with no knowledge on AI but as Sir Andrew said, I feel smarter than CEO's of big companies. I'm glad to have utilized my time by taking up this 4 week course and highly recommend everyone to take up this course as it is very interesting and has been explained in the absolute best way possible. It will surely leave you with having a wider outlook on things and will help you debunk certain misconceptions that are going around about AI as well.I'm already on my way to attend more courses on here!

But what does those words mean? In these course, Andrew will guide through all these concepts and explain in an easy to understand language. More than than, AI for everyones gives way for both individual and organization tactics to cope with the AI age. Last but not least, I appreciate Andrew's effort on the ethical side on the AI. Only with moral consideration, technology can benefit humans.	This is a course I will recommend to everyone ( as the title).

As a medical professional, I expected the course to be not just tough to understand, but I also expected it would be difficult to see through to the end. Surprisingly and gratifyingly, you did such a great job, I actually feel I understood a fair bit of what you learnt. I have downloaded all the transcript and videos and shall be revising them again over the next fortnight to reinforce. Thank you for the efforts you have obviously taken in designing the course for beginners. 	I love the way a topic like AI was made easy to understand.

1036	Jun 05, 2020	5	ai-for-everyone	Most classes available online deal with the detailed technical aspects and do not address important yet widely discussed broader issues or phenomena related to AI. Issues such as how to gauge it's value and what it can and cannot do. As a result you have armchair critics/experts feeding hype and hysteria in general. This course is brilliant in its competent and clear analysis of the actual state of AI and what AI will bring us in the future. As always Andrew Ng shows his teaching brilliance! Excellent indeed!

Every single person on Coursera can take this course and learn a lot of new things about AI, and also learn on how AI can be implemented by you, and how accessible it is. But at the same time the course shows, how you can make your AI economically valuable or you can make yourself valuable by adding skills to yourself in the right niche of AI, since AI is very large sector. Thank you Andrew and Coursera for this wonderful course.	This is a great introductory course with little to no technical studies on AI.

1039	Apr 29, 2020	5	ai-for-everyone	Thankyou Prof. Andrew. This course was a fantastic starting point for a non-tech person working in the field of Marketing (I am a Professor). As you have rightly pointed out, the best an individual can do is to be a life long learner, and to amalgamate the current field of work with AI; I am starting to do the same. Personally, as I hold a Ph.D. in marketing, it will not be that useful if I leave everything and learn AI development, but the best solution will be to integrate AI in my current knowledge.

Insights on ML project management applies to general project managements too.

1061	Apr 18, 2020	5	ai-for-everyone	The instructor, Mr. Andrew Ng , is perhaps one of the best teachers I have ever had in my entire life. He breaks each & every concept down into bite-sized chunks that are easier to understand & fathom. I don't have anything but good things to say about this course. For anyone who wants to start with understanding all those buzzwords that you hear around you such as AI, deep-learning, neural networks, machine learning or computer vision, this course is for you.

1064	Aug 04, 2020	5	ai-for-everyone	Andrew is a phenomenal teacher. He clearly defined the boundaries of this course material and delivered the correct amount of education for the non-technical person. He also provided optional courses to dive deeper for those who were curious and needed more. This course is sufficient to get any company started on its first AI project (with the help recommended in this course). And now I know that process doesn't even start with strategy. Thanks Mr. Ng.

1067	Mar 26, 2019	5	ai-for-everyone	Really great course that gives you a good understanding of business as well as technical aspects of AI. My key takeaway is the importance of first starting with AI projects (pilots) before thinking about adopting AI strategy. 50% planning and 50% implementation is always better than trying to plan 100%. Another interesting topic was the advice for developing countries on how they could have a kick-start on AI, by focusing on their industry strengths.

1068	Apr 30, 2019	5	ai-for-everyone	Anyone interested in AI should take this course.

A complicated looking concept is explained in a logical step by step manner in such a way that the learner is never left feeling bored / disconnected with the topics. The last section on Impact of AI on Society could be slightly shortened / made optional as it is less of technical and more of factual information which maybe of more interest to advanced users of AI.

This is difficult for a someone with less knowledge in Maths. The lab exercises when compared to rest of the course is not satisfactory because in lab sessions, the algorithms were not explained and lacks Student excercise. It also lacks clarity around when to use which algorithm.	The course concentrates more on Maths rather than explaining how algorithm can be implemented in Python.

7387	Nov 06, 2019	1	machine-learning-with-python	This course must be taken off from Coursera. Here is just a couple of reasons: There is very confusing typo and bad description of the final assignment, even though it has been reported, they didn't take 2 minutes to fix it. The final assignment is peer graded (which is really stupid, how do other clueless students know if I did it correctly or not) they provide an answer sheet (not the solution) and I think a lot of students thought it was the solution and marked my assignment incorrectly. The quality of the content provided is poor... If someone knows Python already, then they're wasting their time really, if they don't - this course does not teach them anything... Don't waste your time and money - there are much better options out there.  	This course must be taken off from Coursera.

Please, when you ask for tuning meta-parameters, either be specific or do not provide a false out-dated solution where there is no tuning at all in decision tree, svm, nor regularized logistic regression. Not every new-to-stats understands your misleading instruction of the final project or can be capable of grading according to what is actually correct. The instructor should be more aware of this issue. I ask for a refund, it doesn't worth my money!	I am very frustrated with the course's final project.

7394	Feb 07, 2020	1	machine-learning-with-python	Course is largely a scam. At the end you have to have a peer reviewed project that will prevent you from finishing the course if other people do not grade your project. You can have a high enough overall grade that you could get a 0 on the final and still pass and still be out of luck if people decide to not help with grading, which is exactly what happened to me. Do not waste your time and money if you want to be at the mercy of other people.	Course is largely a scam.

The worst part is that they encourage you to use IBM cloud services which are the worst and require improvement themselves. But the worst part was the peer guided assignment. With no clear instructions, peers that have no idea checking your assignments and long delay for waiting the grade for it, god help you! Don't waste money on this course.

Not professional at all.The course does cover the topics and give us some practice exercises, but when I don't get the right result I cannot know if I don't understand a topic properly or if the instructor made a mistake without checking on other web resources. Plus, some approaches are just dubious, like normalizing by dividing by the max value. There are many other ways to do so that make no assumption on the data distribution.

7427	Oct 16, 2019	2	machine-learning-with-python	"It's
really not very good. It's extremely frustrating and poorly made. It barely
helps equip you with any practical python machine learning knowledge. Good points:Videos provide a good overview of the overall concepts and
ideas The videos and quizes are logically set outBad points:The practice notebooks contain a lot of code and
information which is not explained and didn't really come up on the videos.
Often, you do not know why the code is there, how to make it, or what it does.
So you hardly get any practice using code for machine learning.The final project is a joke. The instructions are not
clear, insufficient, confusing,
and contains grammatical/spelling mistakes. For example, the
instructions for the final project as you to find values that are impossible
for the type of model you're making. The course makers obviously just copied
and pasted stuff and didn't check it. To make it worse, people have pointed out the mistakes and
errors in the forums, but the course makers are either too lazy or don't care
enough to fix it.The forum is full of people asking for help and there
is barely any clarification from the staff.   The course could be improved so much by having clearer and
more instructions/annotations. However, it seems like IBM is satisfied ignoring
the glaring problems present in the course. You money and time would be much better spend on another
machine learning course. But if you're like me and have done the other (comparatively
better) IBM data analysis courses i guess you have no choice but to do this one
in order to get the final certificate. "	"It's

7428	May 08, 2020	2	machine-learning-with-python	The descriptions of the algorithms in the videos were useful for getting basic understanding. There was almost no discussion of the math behind the algorithms and no explanation of how to use the python ML tools. The exercises were primarily executing someone else's code and did not require much effort. Although I now understand the basics of some ML algorithms, I would not be confident in applying them to real problems based on this course.

7429	Apr 28, 2020	2	machine-learning-with-python	A bit dissapointed by this course. The main topics were given clear and simple, but there were too few details, saying that all the details are out of scope of the course. But I would prefer to have more information and also more mathematical details (I find the argument that it needs appropriate background strange: if one wants to learn Machine Learning, should already have some basic mathematical background as knowledge of derivatives, integrals, etc).Another big disappointment was absence of the graded programming assignments, except the final project. Every part of the course had just graded Quiz, but real hand-on scripting in python was given just as non-graded example, and then final assignment basically consisted from the same code.I find this approach quite useless. Also the final assignment had to be done at the IBM Watson website - I guess just for advertisement of IBM services - but this is useless to waste time on registering there, and figuring out how to do things there, if instead could be done inside coursera itself. And finally, there few some mistakes and typos e.g. in the final assignment, which made everything a bit confusing. 	A bit dissapointed by this course.

Thats is why no one is there to update the course.2) The title of the course should be ""Machine Learning with Mathematics"" rather than ""MAchine Learning with Python"" because the emphasis of this course is on using mathematics to solve ML related problems and that is why most of the libraries and techniques used in the python files were not defined.3) This IBM's specialization is of BEGINNER level and the inclusion of an INTERMEDIATE level course which requires you have to have some experience in Data Science and advanced level knowledge of Python is just mind boggling to me. It would have been great if a basic level course of ML would have been developed which emphasized on explaining while using Python libraries would have been much more appropriate for us.4) Lastly, it has confused me while going through this course that numerous times the lecturer spent major time of the lecture in explaining the advanced mathematics which  Pythons libraries can easily do for you, even if he told us that remembering of the mathematics is not need.

7433	Aug 23, 2019	2	machine-learning-with-python	It's too bad some people with phds and very poor teaching skills think they can write up some code and feel they are teaching these classes. That being said, it's super cheap and it's very easy to find information online to supplement the lack of adequate descriptions of the topics. Changes that would make me more likely to take another coursera class :Don't have a bunch of really short videos, combine them into one longer one. If there is text or code on a slide, make sure that is in the transcription.Don't have the dumb popup questions that stop the video and make you find the mouse and click to restart the video. Many of us are listening to the video doing something else, I listen over and over. Sometimes, I have to read the transcription to understand what is being said, so I have to stop, get the mouse, click back up to the slides, press SKIP, etc...If you have an exam, make sure to later send us the answers - e.g. the code that we were expected to write. This is the weakest and most frustrating part of this class. I was not sure how to some things, in part because I wasn't sure what was being asked, to what detail. Even the class discussions showed we weren't sure what data set to use for what. It seems to rely on peer grading, but most of the responses I got from peers was either completely absent or not useful. But thanks for keeping this relatively cheap.

However, had I known what I had to go through to learn the knowledge, I would not have taken the course; the process is too painful. Therefore I would not recommend the course to future learners. Read my review and save yourself $39.1) Too many typos, bugs, inconsistencies throughout the videos and labs. The same mistakes have been brought up by students over and over again on the discussion forum, but have never been fixed.2) Teaching staff do not pay attention to students asking for help. Sometimes when they do answer the question, they give a very vague or irrelevant answer; and when being pointed out by students that their answer is not helpful, the teaching staff do not bother to reply and address the issue. I feel like the teaching staff never went through the entire course themselves so they do not understand our students' concern and frustration.3) A lot of Python codes are never explained or commented. This is a beginner level class but they expect you to be able to code proficiently; otherwise you are going to be stuck with one line of unexplained code for a long time...4) The whole course is like a giant advertisement for IBM Cloud, which is not user-friendly at all.

While I learned some theory (and some mathematics) behind the algorithms we were meant to learn, there was far too little emphasis on how and when to run the actual code. Normally the labs are a helpful part of these courses, wherein I have the opportunity to actually learn code. Not so with this course. When I reached the final project for this class, I had no clue how to do what we were supposed to do, as essentially, it had not been taught within the course. I had to seek out other sources in order to actually learn the material and make a lot of educated guesses about what I was suppose to do. I suspect (or hope) that much of this will become easier when I re-take Statistics and some other maths (not course requirements), but that won't make up for the deficiencies in the course.

7436	May 13, 2020	2	machine-learning-with-python	Like many of the courses, the instructions are not in a format that supports incremental learning and focuses on the mechanics for performing an activity rather than an explanation for why and the reason we are doing these things. The objectives and measures of success for the final exercise is not clearly articulated, causing me to guess as to what the evaluator had wanted us to do. The instructions said to solve for the four types of methods, but left it to the student as to if they wished to generate graphics, etc. If the only objective was to generate the Jaccard score, F1 score, and LogLoss (as appropriate) to complete the activities, then it should have been stated. In addition, the examples presented in the course labs did not have us generating the F1 and Jaccard scores for many of the models.

7437	May 07, 2020	2	machine-learning-with-python	Even for an introductory course most lessons lacked depth. Usually the broad idea of an algorithm is introduced and then an exercise shows a python call to which applies it. However neither are there any theoretical/mathematical insights why the algorithm works, nor does one obtain relevant practical knowledge. E.g. the course fails to even superficially explain the many options and parameters each algorithm has and which are necessary to actually apply it in practice. What makes it worse is that there is apparently no support and maintenance for this course: There are tons of smaller and some larger mistakes in the lectures as well as the exercises, however reports of those as well as most other questions in the discussion forums remain unanswered.

Much like some of the other courses in the IBM Data Science certificate program, I HIGHLY suggest adding an image of what the solution should be instead of leaving it up to people to determine what they think is right or wrong.

7476	Jul 04, 2019	3	machine-learning-with-python	This was a good course to see how the basic ML models can be used with clear examples in Python.  It was a very good sequel to the Stanford as this course didn't go into detail on the algorithms or any depth in to the math behind the scenes.  In fact, you could ignore the equations and still do fine.  Unfortunately, I didn't feel I learned enough, specifically about how to tune the parameters and improve the results of different algorithms.  The final could be accomplished by simply cutting and pasting the work done in the non-graded 'labs' and providing any level of accuracy scores.  I would have welcomed more depth on optimization.  Also the hardest part of the course was using matplotlib but you didn't even need to understand it to pass.   Overall, I'm glad I took this course.  It was very helpful in my learning journey.

The final assignment, though, seemed to require knowledge not yet learned, which made it rough to complete.  Also, although I completed the notebook, all of my cells were not visible to the reviewer even though my settings were such that all cells should have been visible to him/her.  I restarted the kernels and re-ran my code a couple times and it was finally visible when I opened the shareable link.  That delayed my receipt of an accurate score for a few days. Ugh.

7485	Aug 06, 2020	3	machine-learning-with-python	This course excellently explained the mathematical and theoretical foundations behind some of the machine learning algorithms, but how to program these algorithms in Python was not explained in the videos and it was left to the viewers to learn themselves in coding assignments, which is the disadvantage of this course. I was just able to do it because I previously had learnt upto some extent from some other websites. So my advice is that if you still want to take this course, then after learning python, learn python libraries of Pandas, Numpy, Scipy and Matplotlib, and after that learn the sklearn libraries along with some theoretical background, and after that enroll in this course.

situation but one thing I would like to add the lab tools are not available most of the time
 but hopefully got to managed by practicing on my local Jupyter Notebook with the help of 
sir's saeed aghabozorgi github repo. As I had some prior knowledge of Machine Learning so 
the course was on intermediary level for me on scale of learning and enhancing my 
introductory hands-on skills of training . 

I have successfully completed the project although it was challenging but enjoyed a lot while 
learning and building my final_capstone_project.

with no hidden code cells to help others and inspire with my work.

7579	Jul 02, 2020	4	machine-learning-with-python	The content in this course is presented clearly through the videos provided, and the ungraded labs are quite helpful in learning how to implement the algorithms discussed in the videos.  I took this course by itself (not as part of the IBM Data Science Certification), and there was some stuff I had to look up, especially about Pandas data frames and how to work with them.  Maybe that content is covered in the courses before this one in the certification sequence.  I didn't see a prerequisite knowledge list for this course, but that would be helpful for future learners who are considering taking this course by itself.  The reason I'm giving this course 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the typos that occurred, especially in the directions of the final graded project.  I was able to read through the discussion threads about the final project to get a better understanding of what I was expected to do (because part of the directions don't make sense), but those posts are from over a year ago, meaning the typos haven't as of yet been corrected in the course.  Otherwise, I found this course to be enriching and enjoyable!  Thank you!

7580	Jul 10, 2020	4	machine-learning-with-python	 The course is not for someone who is new to python. This course requires some prior proficiency and understanding  of the language.There are no professional notes at end of each module or section like some other courses, so you need to take your own notes while going through videos. Having proper summarized notes like the ones in Andrew NG machine learning course would have been great.There has to be some proper videos / guidance notes or well documented pdfs focusing on the data pre-processing and related components in Python and all other details as well regarding training a model, assignments are directly provided to be completed in Python without any tutorial of the sameOverall a good course but it would be great to have all documentation. Also since the title itself makes it clear that course will be in Python, Kindly add videos to the course which help more understanding of all concepts through Python, currently all videos only have conceptual explanation but no video touches the Python component or how to go about the implementations in real world.Thanks	The course is not for someone who is new to python.

Instructions provided in this course are obsolete.Another thing, for someone, who didn’t take machine learning courses somewhere else, the amount of theory presented here is not enough. It is fine that you can put stuff inside your python (yes, I said this), but you have to understand, why are you doing this. You have to be understand how does it work. These libraries is just to try something out fast. The real implementation of the sophisticated algorithms is much more complicated. That doesn’t mean you have to be a PhD to do it, but you have to understand basic math that is going behind the curtain. It’s enough even for one algorithm. How many will know the difference between bias and variance after this course? How many will be able to say, how it can be fixed? Try to answer on this question.Regards,	4 stars only.

7582	Mar 28, 2020	4	machine-learning-with-python	The content of the course is very well designed and it is very easy to follow. The Teachers have done a fantastic job explaining the content. I would like to make the following suggestions:There should be more hands on graded exercises. Instead of one exercise at the end, it would have helped if relevant section was graded after it was taught. There is too much focus on Classification. Machine learning consists of equal parts of value prediction and class prediction. There is nothing on things like Linear regression. It should have at least been included as a ungraded exercise, so that I know what Python functions are used. 	The content of the course is very well designed and it is very easy to follow.

7583	Jan 06, 2020	4	machine-learning-with-python	One of the best course for the beginners who want to learn the machine learning concept from basics along with the theory. The course lecture only contains the theoretical part but the lab part are only being instructed within a notebook link. This course is great but can be improved by adding some lectures of the lab or practical part by specifying how those codes are being implemented. Although the Notebook also explains the best and also helps in learning the practical skill. The assignment given helps a lot in learning the modals easily and visualizing the result.

Several in-depth topics are not covered stating that they are out of scope for this course.The course allows us to use an online tool for lab work and assignments with many relevant libraries, thereby avoiding any software/library installation issues, etc. There are relatively less number of videos but they are to the point.Labworks need to be self-learnt(no separate videos for code), although the notebooks that are shared tries explaining the code a bit.Overall for a new learner in this field, it's a good start.

You can find information on it online so its not a big issue but it would have been nice if it were included. Another method, the silhouette score, could have also been mentioned.

Gives a good start to learn ML further. One star lost from the fact that some of the quizzes are badly designed -- multiple choice questions with slightly ambiguous answer possibilities where you get no partial credit nor any feedback on what went wrong. I still have no idea why some answers were right or wrong as I just had to try too many different quesses to get a passing grade.

7590	Aug 11, 2019	4	machine-learning-with-python	I really enjoy this course. It teaches me a lot of basic machine learning model, method and data analyzing technique. However, I still recommend that it should have coding assignment for every week exercise. It is because learning from video is simple but hard to do implementation. The best way to learn data analysis is to implement or do the real stuff by ourselves. It is necessary to put an assignment to force every learner try and error. This is my opinion for this course.

7591	Jul 01, 2019	4	machine-learning-with-python	The rubric for the last assignment was too arbitrary.

I would put force students to put random seed on models in order to achieve similar results to achieve more homogeneity and therefore an easier way to grade. Perhaps you could put a section at the end that allows for further parameter tuning if the student so desires.	The rubric for the last assignment was too arbitrary.

Overall a very good experience.The only constructive criticism I would give would be for the videos to give a quick overview/introduction of the code used in Python for the algorithms, which is then practiced in the labs. At the moment, the videos give an excellent explanation to everything but you don't see the actual code used until the lab.

Getting the good background on the algorithms independent of language or library, and then applying that in the labs is effective. I will refer back to this class as I continue learning about ML. I had trouble getting my final project graded - but realized I hadn't shared my project correctly (at first didn't share code cells), and had to save a `version` of the notebook so my edits would be available to the other students to be graded. Leave yourself extra time for your peers to review your project, and check that the shared link to your notebook shows what you expect. You don't need to post in the forum to get your project graded - lots of students were doing that..

7901	Mar 10, 2019	5	machine-learning-with-python	Lots to learn in this class! Week 3 was definitely heavy and challenging in the middle of it, but the course really builds up well and makes sense by the end of it and I understand why those topics were combined as they were.  I found the labs most helpful when they included # hashtag explanations/documentations when introducing new code to explain the different parameters and reasons for using them, or if establishing parameters in the code with explanatory definitions/names to guide the user through new operations.  In the very last lab, I think they included a link to the pandas API reference page with that specific new operation. I found that really helpful because I had already been going to the pandas page to learn more about other new operations as they were introduced in previous labs.	Lots to learn in this class!

That last statement described my workflow during the final assignment/project of this course.Quite simply, this course was brilliant because not only did it bring everything we've learned so far together but it also built upon the last course and properly introduced us to Machine Learning and its applications. In his videos, Saeed successfully breaks down complex topics into digestible byte-sized content and ensures that you intuitively understand what is going on. One of the best pieces of advice I have received in regards to my learning and in life in general is to make sure you have a strong grasp of the fundamentals and these become building blocks to much more complex topics. That in a nutshell is what I believe this course has done for me.To those who are reading this review, trying to decide whether or not to take this course... just do it! What are you waiting for? No seriously? This might be one of the best decisions you make this year. If you've been racing through the other courses up to this point, I advise you to slow down once you get here and really try to digest what Saeed has taught here.Watch the videos, pause, take notes, rewind, continue watching, learn, code.

7907	May 14, 2020	5	machine-learning-with-python	I love every bit of this course. It is very informative and the explanation by the instructor is second to none. He explained most of the concepts especially using real life scenarios like customer segmentation, detection of cancer and many more. Using these real life examples in the explanation made me understand the course very well and also appreciate machine learning. It will be very easy with anyone with mathematical background though people that are not mathematical inclined may have some difficulties understanding some of the concepts. Nevertheless, going through the lab section will make you understand the concepts very well even if you didn't get all the theoretical concepts. The final project was also centered based on what was taught and easy to follow by anyone that paid apt attention to the lectures and followed duly in the lab exercises. Kudos to the instructor.

provided basic to intermediate knowledge of most of machine learning algorithms,

The best title might be this one, I guess:             ""Different machine learning problems, and algorithms """	By Nima G M	en
7911	Jul 15, 2020	5	machine-learning-with-python	This course is perfect for beginners. It gives a basic idea about clustering, regression, decision tree, recommender system, classification algorithms along with Labs. You should know a little bit about Python programming and few libraries like NumPy, pandas, sciPy, and sci-kit learn. The Labs are great because you will be using the concepts learnt in the video lectures on the sample datasets and when you see the results, it will motivate you to go for some hands-on projects from Coursera Rhyme  Project Network and it will be beneficial for you.

7912	Apr 14, 2019	5	machine-learning-with-python	"This course is an excellent platform to understand the basics of Machine Learning with python. The lab tools pioneer a way to understand the code and implement it. The videos are crisp and clearly mention the scope of the course which creates a curiosity to know more. However, the peer graded assignment is not an efficient way as 'sample notebook"" paves the way to plagiarism. The peer grading also restricts the user creativity to write a simpler code as it may not be understood by other peers. Overall I am very happy with the course"	"This course is an excellent platform to understand the basics of Machine Learning with python.

7913	Jan 14, 2020	5	machine-learning-with-python	Excellent content and relatable use cases. As a beginner in data science with no formal programming, the information is presented in a way to help you understand the fundamentals and then apply them using the pre-built python packages that are widely available. I started with data science 3 years ago and it was very difficult to get started without any programming or statistics background. This course does a tremendous job of making it accessible, understandable and quite frankly a lot fun in the process. 	Excellent content and relatable use cases.

The topics are explained in quite enought details, allowing you to use learned approach in practical way.What I would personally wish - a bit more examples of different kinds. It should not be included into main structure of the course (to decrease a work load of Instructors and Students). It needs to go into Optional part, but I'm sure - who is interested in, will finish the task.	Well structured course, which will give you understanding of the applied way of working.

Little bit of difficulty i faced while doing main project as there was less guidance on what we have to show at the end of project. But it was a great course. Worth spending time over it.

For someone who knew absolutely nothing about machine learning, this gave me the background to understand how computers work with machine learning and where they are used in our everyday lives. The reason I give this course a 4 instead of a 5 is because this course makes you want to continue to do machine learning, but does not give you recommendations on how to do so. Although there are further resources to learn about machine learning which is GREAT, there is no clear direction on how to do it on your own computer or how to download software that could do machine learning. If this was improved, I would recommend this course to the highest degree for everyone. 	I think this course was awesome.

In my case I wanted to have an appreciation for it without having to write Python code, and the course delivered.Videos were almost always worthwhile, especially the panel discussions.It would be nice for the Coursera platform to allow me to easily find my previous comments on a particular week.

Apparently you can't update anything on here because they haven't. Also while machine learning is an interesting and emerging  topic, the lecturer makes it sound like old news and shows no enthusiasm when presenting this course. There are better places to learn about machine learning, for example Google has a FREE online course that I used to help me while doing this course. Coursera/Michigan needs to review this course because it is not up to any standards.	This class is useless. There are countless errors that go unfixed in the lectures and autograder.

9561	Nov 07, 2017	1	python-machine-learning	My biggest critique of this class is that it is not challenging at all. Homework assignments are just a repeat of the lectures and take less than an hour if you took notes on the lectures. In other words, there is no value in the homework assignments. The first two courses in this specialization were awesome. We did real life examples for homework assignments and through research you learned more than you had asked for. It was perfect. Even in lectures, there is nothing 'applied' about this course. The professor just covers the content with no real-life examples. Very mundane and unexciting.Also, why not talk about multi-label classification? Professor takes a real example with multiple labels (handwritten digits), makes it a binary class and then proceeds to explain it... Thanks. My recommendation would be to restructure the homework assignments. Instead of having 7 questions that spoon-fed you the solution of a primitive problem, ask us to do some Kaggle challenges, or give us a topic that we go out and solve, do some peer-reviewed assignment. Lastly, if you don't have time or don't want to explain important concepts like pipeline, nested cross validation, and multi-label classification, add them as resources. I am NOT confident in my ability to solve machine learning problems in Python from this course, nor is this course worth recommending.

9562	Jun 14, 2017	1	python-machine-learning	I'm disappointed that I took this class, poor design and delivery. Machine Learning is an exciting and fun topic, but you'd never guess it from this class, and the way the instructor delivers the content. It's a shame that the designers want to throw every possible model at you in 1 or 2 weeks, before having a discussion on model evaluation. This course focuses more on the academic than the practical, and doesn't try to explain these topics in an approachable manner. There are far better and engaging options available.

9563	May 03, 2020	1	python-machine-learning	This course is all over the place, and compared to the previous courses in this specialization, this seems like more of an effort to gloss over the documentation and capabilities of SciKit Learn rather than focusing on a handful of the most important ones. The course lacks focus, the material taught is not rich, and you are better off just reading the documentation on your own. The book recommended at the start of the course is excellent, and reading that instead might be more fruitful for you.

9591	Jun 13, 2017	2	python-machine-learning	Not very good compared to the first two courses :( :( :( ... I took a Machine Learning Class from Stanford which was incredibly well put together and presented (though to be fair, it was 12 weeks), but it was in MatLab and I wanted to take a course in Python just to have a different perspective and solidify my understanding. Unfortunately, I find this course to be confusing more than anything. If I hadn't taken the Stanford course before, I'd be completely lost. It's very dry, dense, and hand-wavy and doesn't go into a whole lot of details with anything leaving you wondering what's happening and why and how... I don't approve of jumping straight to using the built-in functions if you don't understand the processes behind them (which I personally don't have a solid grasp on them still) ... I think they are just trying to fit too much information into four weeks and it's really lacking. Maybe if you're already familiar with linear regression, it's not as hard to follow. Either way, I'd recommend either taking the Stanford class first, or learning about this stuff elsewhere before starting this course.	Not very good compared to the first two courses :( :( :( ...

However, the course should really be titled ""Evaluating Classification Methods"", as that is pretty much the focus of the entire class. The lectures (especially in Week 2) were SOOOOOO long and very hard to absorb, that even double-speed didn't help. In education, less is more. I would compare this course to the reading of a textbook. There was very little focus on making sense of the code and solving real-world problems and far too much emphasis on shotgunning (what felt like) every single classification technique known to man and trivializing pros and cons of each method. To make matters even more strange, PCA and other useful methods were pushed into ""optional"". This course should really be a two-part course, especially since the claim is that the course requires 18 hours of time. Sure, type in the code just as the professor does and you get the right answer, but meaning is lost of if you are to adhere to the timeline. If I didn't know more about machine learning and this class had been the first one I had taken, I couldn't run fast enough from the pursuit of a career in this field.

I feel like the videos were also much more bland than previous courses in this specialization. Additionally, while feature selection and data cleaning are large components of the final project, they are not at all the focus of what is taught in the course! I think this course was trying to do too much all at once, and leaves you with a shallow understanding of several things instead of a good understanding of any specific thing.

9621	Sep 30, 2020	2	python-machine-learning	Really disappointed with the course ...you may ask why??The first thing is the instructor , super boring. The instructor (with all due respect) was very dry and the lectures were super uninteresting. When he keeps on talking code, but doesn't really explain stuff. The material and lectures were dry and colorless. Me without having good statistics background had huge difficulties understanding the concepts. Please i recommend everyone to have good knowledge in statistics before starting the course. ABSOLUTELY NOT THE BEGINNER LEVEL AND NEITHER INTERMIDIATE LEVEL .the course is quiteeeee difficult.You also need to have a lot of self study , which i am not a big fan of. I hope they make the course more fun rather than a man constantly talking on the screen .	Really disappointed with the course ...you may ask why??The first thing is the instructor , super boring.

9623	May 02, 2019	3	python-machine-learning	I want to give this course a higher score because I do think I learned A TON. However, I learned a ton because the course had some flaws in instructions and assignments that required some frustrating moments and a lot of outside work to correct. If you take this course, DISCUSSION FORUMS are a must because of all the errors and bugs in assignments. The explanations are a little 'too rosy' in the videos in my opinion (they show best case scenarios) so there's a disconnect in what i actually had to do to pass the assignments which tended to have lots of room for improvement. That said, if you are willing to go out on your own and figure it out (mentors are so-so in actually helping), then this course is a great ML workout!

Following the course, you can learn several interesting details about how to work in the field, but it is important to take into account that it is not possible to learn the algorithms during the course, since a huge amount of material is covered during a short time; to make the most of the course you have to know them in advance. It bothered me to discover that the course was planned for five weeks but Coursera has reduced it to four, removing the possibility of practicing exercises on unsupervised learning.

Good:
The course syllabus is quite well designed for an applied intro ML courseAssignments are nice & force you to think; you cannot simply watch the lectures & complete them straightaway; which is good in my opinion.Needs to Improve:
The lectures are atrociously boring. The professor seems to be reading out from a teleprompter in a flat pitch.There are parts where the intuition behind the concepts are well explained and others where you are left staring at stars and better off learning from other sources over the net.
The course seems to have been all but abandoned. Common mistakes in the assignment setup & lecture recordings have not been corrected since the course was first offered 2.5 years ago. The discussion forums keep getting spammed on similarly asked questions which can be easily solved by correcting the assignment errors and providing a few clearer comments/instructions. Week 3 lectures definitely need to be re-recorded as there is a correction prompt on every video. There is one 'Mentor' who helps out as a volunteer. No one else to moderate the forums.The course pace is quite uneven and patchy. Week 2 is extremely heavy while week 1 super light. Week 3 is good but week 4 feels half done/rushed. Seems like there is an arbitrary administrative requirement to do a four week course from UMich.
All in all, I did not come away impressed & elated from the course. I did expect much better from my Alma Mater.

The gap between the lecture content and the assignments is the typical chasm for this U.Michigan ""speciality"", and frankly you end up basing assignment answers more on internet research rather than lecture content.I'd sum it up as a substantial missed opportunity. The last assignment is really good in terms of doing a realistic Machine Learning project, but the preceding course content doesn't give you the tools or frameworks to do that project in a logical, industry standard workflow. It gives you an idea of what the tools are, but not how to really apply them all together in an efficient and logical series of steps.It's as if those who designed the course decided that learners needed a tough-love approach, like a trainer lying down on the grass and showing learners swimming strokes, and then just throwing those learners into a pool and expecting them to keep afloat, and combine what they remember with what they see other more experienced swimmers in the pool doing.

9630	Oct 21, 2017	3	python-machine-learning	This course provided a good structure and order to learn introductory machine learning concepts in Python. However, I thought the lectures in particular were needlessly more abstract than the previous data science courses in this specialization. In my experience, learning a new programming concept comes from practically writing code then observing what happened. The earlier data science courses were great because you could test code with the lecturer as the video progressed and learn from it.  The lecture content here structured to discuss broader machine learning concepts, rather than setup to follow along in the notebook. I found this was okay for introducing the idea of different machine learning concepts, though without the practical application and observation it became difficult to remember these concepts or test what I was hearing. I found most of my learning happened in the assignments or by following more practical online resources. The course could be improved by tying the notebook modules more closely to the video content, making it easier for learners to follow along.

The content is very accessible and the assignments are simple enough to work through without frustration, but challenging enough to help you understand how to apply machine learning algorithms on your own.I did purchase the book recommended, Introduction to Machine Learning with Python by Andreas C. Muller and Sarah Guido. The lectures in this course are basically paraphrase the book. Frankly, I think you'd get more value from this course if you read Chapter 2 in its entirety and  follow along with the juypter notebooks provide with the book. It's easy to tell when someone is teaching you vs. reading to you— this course's lectures were definitely the latter.	I'm glad there was an introductory course like this offered for machine learning.

It would be better if they used Christopher Brooks from the first two courses as he is more engaging and he seems to have a lot more experience in public talking. Another thing is that there are serious bugs with the assignments. This course needs serious redesign.All in all, don't spend your precious time and money on this one.

9633	Oct 19, 2018	3	python-machine-learning	The quality of the teaching is a marked improvement over module 1 & 2 in this specialisation. In my opinion it would be a 4/5 star course on that alone however there is 1 minor and 1 major issue. Starting small, the course could do with better summary notes/cheatsheets to help remember details and as prompts when doing assignments; I found it really annoying to have to skim read the lecture video transcript or scan through the videos. The MAJOR issue is the problem sets and the autograder. I really feel the teachers need to re-write this whole section before I could recommend this course.

Furthermore, the thinks in the course are shallow depth, conversely the assignment are little bit difficult especially on assignment4. I mean if the goal is to train our to do some real world data you may can shrink the dataset, the large dataset would takes more time to training which would cost more time to debug. Anyway, this is a great course but I think it's better to do slight change on the quiz and assignment.	Most of the content professor taught are intuitive, but the PPT seems helpless.

Not heavy in mathematics (altough, I would recommend reading how models are supposed to work), the objectiv eis to have a practical understanding of how machine learning is applied and the important concepts to consider for a succesful model building. The focus is to have hand-on experience with the sklearn library.I don't grant 5 starts (I hesitated for 4), as the course was designed back in 2018, therefore, you sometimes struggle with legacy libraries. Another issue, is that there are some hiccups when it comes to assignment uploads (for instance, the address of csv files!). As a student, this will make you hesistate and question wether the instructor screwed up with the autograder or not, which IS stressful.Quiz 4 suddenly became non-forgiving, multiple choice answer have to be answered with 100% certainity to score full point. Quite anti-climatic, considering that previous quizes didn't work like that.Final assignment is quite challenging, and might make the new student suffer.I appreciate the instructors and Kevyn Collins for this great course.

9707	Jun 03, 2020	4	python-machine-learning	My actual rating is 3.5 stars. This is the best course yet in this Specialization. Pros: I prefer Professor Collin-Thompson's delivery compared to Professor Brook in the previous modules. I think he gives a good overview and sufficient depth for an applied course, compared to Professor Brooks which I find to be quite superficial most of the time, and weirdly detailed in other parts. Assignment is good enough for reinforcement learning and definitely better planned. I also appreciate the link to additional readings which are quite informative. Cons: Assignment auto-grader. This  is still the biggest letdown of all the courses in this specialization Codes which work on your laptop or suggested elsewhere on Stackoverflow etc fails to pass the autograder, so 30-40% of the time of the assignment is spent on wrangling the code to pass the autograder. Note: If i haven't taken a Machine Learning course by Professor Andrew Ng, this course would definitely be much harder. This course doesn't go to much into the background knowledge,and they mentioned this many times. But I appreciated the applied aspect, since this was what I was looking for.

9708	Jan 19, 2020	4	python-machine-learning	I had no ML background, although I have the math the models are based on. The material seemed more than week's worth for a couple of weeks. The quizzes make sure you don't miss the key points you need to take away and need for the assignment.  Most information or key words are in the slides, but course expects you to be independent enough (intermediate) to learn closely related ideas on your own via StackOverFlow and discussion forums. The discussion forums were especially helpful for this course, but then online discussions makes it more studying alone. Discussions helped me trouble-shoot and get better ideas how to approach the problems generally. I can explore and use ML and sklearn on my own, which thankfully seems to be a goal of this professor.  No material could be left out, but when more videos, better longer time estimate for the week would be nice.	I had no ML background, although I have the math the models are based on.

9709	Nov 28, 2019	4	python-machine-learning	This course involves lots of concepts and algorithms in machine learning. As it is said by the teacher, for time, effort and aim limitations, this course only involves basic concepts and usage of sci-kit learn.  It is a good hand-on course for beginners. Assignments are not so challenging compared with the previous two courses in the same specialization. I just finish assignments by following the module code in the course. I feel like not study as much as I expected through the assignment. I hope assignments can be changed by varieties and difficulties to let students know how a machine learning project is like and how the evaluation works but not simply call the precision/accuracy/recall function and the assignment finishes.

9710	Jun 12, 2020	4	python-machine-learning	I personally enjoyed this course much more than the previous 2 courses in the specialisation. Overall, this course is ambitious and covers a lot of different algorithms. For each algorithm, a brief intuition is provided and we are taught how to code in Python. For this course, I felt that the assignments were a closer fit to the content covered in the videos (unlike the previous courses where the assignments required much more independent learning). However, this course will not provide the mathematical rigour that some learners may expect. Furthermore, the amount of content covered could be a bit overwhelming. It would be useful if the instructor could summarise the different steps we should take when faced with a ML problem, esp. for deciding which algorithm to use (since so many were covered)	I personally enjoyed this course much more than the previous 2 courses in the specialisation.

9712	Jan 15, 2018	4	python-machine-learning	Very good course. The content is excellent. You can get a good understanding of many popular Machine Learning algorithms. Maybe the most valuable concept you can learn is how to evaluate a classification model. It is also an applied course, so anyone more concerned of the applications than the theory will enjoy it. The only drawback is that the evaluation of the assigments is done automatically, and you can have frustrating limitations for an answer that is correct but that is not EXACTLY as expected (I mean even the data structer have to much perfectly). The server also have quite restrictive memory limitations and the error messages are not always very helpful, but the staff will help you if you insist enough.	Very good course.

The only drawback is that the evaluation of the assigments is done automatically, and you can have frustrating limitations for an answer that is correct but that is not EXACTLY as expected (I mean even the data structer have to much perfectly). The server also have quite restrictive memory limitations and the error messages are not always very helpful, but the staff will help you if you insist enough.	By Nicolás C	en
9713	Jan 28, 2019	4	python-machine-learning	The course is an excellent tour of machine learning methods. The best thing is that it provides the python codes for various applications of machine learning. These can represent a great starting point for real applications.   The  significant parameters of each model  are explained and the usage of the main models is well depicted.  However, the course is very dense and I think it should have been divided in 6-8 weeks. At least the unsupervised learning part, which is optional in the Week 4 should have a dedicated week, with assignments. Before doing this course I recommend something  like the course of Andrew Ng (without that one,  for me it would have been more difficult to follow this one).

9714	Aug 10, 2020	4	python-machine-learning	I found the course content ideal to start my journey in machine learning.  It was a bit much for me to understand so much within so little time but now, I know where should I emphasize more and how to have more concrete idea and knowledge about ml. The course would have been the best if the content were scaled down to less and had been a bit more easygoing but people with high processing and patient brain might get the best output from this course.  I did not understand a lot of things and had to self study a lot but thanks to it, I got  a good start. Thanks	I found the course content ideal to start my journey in machine learning.

A lot of the topics covered were mentioned very briefly without much explanation of when or how they should be applied - especially week three felt like a barrage of ""this exists, this exists, this exists..."" without much explanation, and I don't think I'll retain very much of it. The Week 4 assignment, however, was adequately challenging and did give me cause to go back, review and dig deeper into many of the topics covered previously."

9716	May 03, 2020	4	python-machine-learning	Overall a good course! It was really what I was looking for: main focus is on how to apply algorithms and pros and cons of each model, instead of exhaustively explaining the theory behind each one, like some others courses do. The downside was the grade system. The platform has a lot of potential, but crashes all the time and there are many errors to troubleshoot when submitting assignments.  The time invested to troubleshoot these problems was really frustrating, and probably the main reason i won't continue with the specialization. 	Overall a good course!

9720	Mar 14, 2018	4	python-machine-learning	More detailed videos/maybe case studies on applying the algorithms in real-life jobs would be good. The assignments are generally fairly good, but can be pretty easily cribbed from the course module notebooks. While this is okay since knowing exactly what syntax to write is less important when there are a lot of examples online, it would be good to have the assignments maybe incorporate more thinking about the models and what they mean.

It covers a *lot* of material and the pacing is *very* fast. Week 2 is particularly long, and if you are still a student/working it may take an extra week to complete the course. Quizzes and assignments are not terribly difficult, but be careful of the project assignment in Week 4 (though the bar for a 100% is quite low!). Finally, the accompanying Jupyter Notebooks are very helpful and there are many helpful links to outside resources as well.A few of the lecture videos feel like an early draft rather than production-quality, with lots of time spent on repeating phrases. The instructor mentions things to be covered ""later,"" but that ""later"" never comes (for example, in discussing Grid Search). For some background, this course appears to have been repeatedly delayed before its release. To me, is understandable that the creators wanted to get this course out given the demand, but the rush is felt.Ultimately, however, this is still an excellent introduction to Python Machine Learning, and I do feel the course is well worth taking.

The executable modules are perfect to bootstrap machine learning projects. Homework assignments can get complicated, and you should be familiar with advanced data structure manipulation in pandas and numpy to make progress. Assignment grading is very well done.

It barely covers Neural networks, which are the hot topic right now, but it gives you a lot of tools that will suffice in the vast majority of cases, and teaches fundamentals that are also applied to deep learning if one decides to go forward and learn other libraries like tensorflow. All in all, a great addition to anyone's toolbelt, be it engineers, scientists or people trying to jump to a data science career.	Great course on the basics of machine learning.

In this instance, this was not the case and you could spend more time understanding the material. The instructor spoke slowly and clearly.I do have to say I purchased the corresponding book as recommended but I didn't feel it was necessary. Good book, I just think the material in the course was presented well enough on its own.	The course was very well prepared and the instructor presented the material clearly and informatively.

9932	Oct 03, 2020	5	python-machine-learning	The course provides a good overview of ML techniques and potential gotchas, and then goes into a real life example which helps round up the theoretical overview with application to real world data and their challenges.  This provides a great introduction to ML which positions you to delve into it in much more detail and help in your journey as a Data Science practitioner. Must commend University of Michigan on coming up with the fine balance of theory and practice, which is essential in this rapidly changing space.

One Note: this course is over 2 years old and the Staff is pretty slow to respond. But the Forums have enough information to get you to self-solve your problem.Good luck.

10730	Apr 22, 2019	2	machine-learning-duke	Much weaker than Stanford offerings.  Strange buildup of topics for a breezy, but not particular accurate understanding.  For example:  multiple layers of a neural network is introduced before multiple category classification.  Transfer learning is introduced incorrectly. The matrix representation of multiple features of an example with multiple examples is introduced very late in the course. The instructor is conscientious and seemingly knows the material despite using non-standard terminology.  One wonders if he is primarily a teacher/researcher and rarely a practitioner.  One wonders if Duke is a leader in machine learning research.	Much weaker than Stanford offerings.  Strange buildup of topics for a breezy, but not particular accurate understanding.

10732	Oct 29, 2019	3	machine-learning-duke	Although the course is great from a theoretical point of view, but it has two major flaws. First, it doesn't provide the fundamentals of Machine Learning but instead directly moves to Deep Learning, although building those concepts from ground up. Also, from a practical point of view, this course is really lacking as there is not a single explanation video on any of the coding aspect of Deep Learning and the videos that even exist just ask us to read through the Documentation to learn the practical aspect.

10741	Apr 22, 2020	4	machine-learning-duke	I would like to thank Prof. Carin for a very lucid and intuitive explanation of the major concepts in Machine Learning covered in this class. This is the best explanation of the concepts of CNN and Reinforcement Learning that I have found so far !!!I am also a little bit disappointed by the set of Programming Exercises at the end of some the lectures by other teachers. I think instead of giving students examples of programming using raw, low-level  TensorFlow APIs because it overwhelms the main concepts. It is better to use high-level back end tool like Keras (NOT Slim !!!)

10742	Feb 24, 2020	4	machine-learning-duke	It is a very basic introductory course to important fields in machine learning. It tells important models like CNN and RNN and LSTM. but it does not go deeper into the technical levels of these models. Some parts about mathematics are not very satisfying. Also I feel like the course doesn't provide enough training for the coding work. Nonetheless, it is a good course to start with machine learning and the instructors repeat the concepts from the previous class, which helps me a lot in understanding the concepts.	It is a very basic introductory course to important fields in machine learning. It tells important models like CNN and RNN and LSTM. but it does not go deeper into the technical levels of these models. Some parts about mathematics are not very satisfying.
