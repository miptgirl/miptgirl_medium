      "Final Answer: The `WITH TOTALS` modifier in ClickHouse queries is used to calculate the total for a result set, which can be very useful for reporting purposes. However, there are several performance considerations and limitations associated with using this modifier:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Performance Impact**: \n",
      "   - Adding the `WITH TOTALS` modifier to a query can lead to additional computational overhead. This is because ClickHouse needs to perform an extra aggregation step to compute the totals.\n",
      "   - The performance impact is more noticeable when working with large datasets or complex queries. In such scenarios, the extra computation can significantly increase the query execution time.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Memory Usage**:\n",
      "   - The `WITH TOTALS` modifier can also increase memory consumption since it requires storing intermediate results for the additional aggregation.\n",
      "   - If your query is already close to the memory limits of your ClickHouse server, adding `WITH TOTALS` might push it over the edge, leading to query failures or degraded performance.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Limitations**:\n",
      "   - The totals row is computed for the entire result set, which might not always align with the user's expectations if filters are applied after the `WITH TOTALS` computation.\n",
      "   - The `WITH TOTALS` modifier does not work with all types of queries. It is primarily designed to work with `GROUP BY` queries. If used with other types of queries, it may not produce the desired results.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Best Practices**:\n",
      "   - Use the `WITH TOTALS` modifier judiciously, especially in production environments where performance is critical.\n",
      "   - Consider whether you can achieve the same result through application-side logic or by running a separate totals query.\n",
      "   - Always test the performance impact of `WITH TOTALS` in your specific use case before deploying it in a live environment.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, while the `WITH TOTALS` modifier can be very convenient for generating summarized data, it is important to be aware of the potential performance implications and limitations. Proper testing and consideration of alternative approaches can help mitigate any negative impacts.\n",

      "### Functionality of `WITH TOTALS`\n",
      "The `WITH TOTALS` modifier in SQL is used to add an extra row to the result set which contains the total values of the selected columns. This is particularly useful when you want to aggregate data and see the sum, average, or other aggregate functions without running a separate query.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Example Usage\n",
      "Here’s a simple example to illustrate how `WITH TOTALS` works:\n",
      "\n",
      "```sql\n",
      "SELECT \n",
      "    category, \n",
      "    SUM(sales) \n",
      "FROM \n",
      "    sales_data \n",
      "GROUP BY \n",
      "    category \n",
      "WITH TOTALS\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "In this example, the query groups the sales data by category and calculates the sum of sales for each category. The `WITH TOTALS` modifier will add an additional row at the end of the result set, displaying the total sum of sales across all categories.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Performance Considerations\n",
      "While the `WITH TOTALS` modifier is very convenient, it’s important to be aware of its performance implications. Using `WITH TOTALS` can add overhead to your query execution, especially if you are working with large datasets. The additional computation required to calculate the totals can impact query performance. It's advisable to test your queries with and without the `WITH TOTALS` modifier to understand its impact on your specific dataset and environment.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Conclusion\n",
      "The `WITH TOTALS` modifier is a powerful tool for aggregating data and getting a quick overview of totals directly in your result set. Just keep in mind the potential performance trade-offs when working with large datasets.\n",

      "1. **Performance Impact**: Adding the `WITH TOTALS` modifier to a query can lead to additional computational overhead. This is because ClickHouse needs to perform an extra aggregation step to compute the totals. The performance impact is more noticeable when working with large datasets or complex queries, as the extra computation can significantly increase the query execution time.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Memory Usage**: The `WITH TOTALS` modifier can also increase memory consumption since it requires storing intermediate results for the additional aggregation. If your query is already close to the memory limits of your ClickHouse server, adding `WITH TOTALS` might push it over the edge, leading to query failures or degraded performance.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Limitations**: The totals row is computed for the entire result set, which might not always align with the user's expectations if filters are applied after the `WITH TOTALS` computation. Additionally, the `WITH TOTALS` modifier does not work with all types of queries. It is primarily designed to work with `GROUP BY` queries. If used with other types of queries, it may not produce the desired results.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Best Practices**: Use the `WITH TOTALS` modifier judiciously, especially in production environments where performance is critical. Consider whether you can achieve the same result through application-side logic or by running a separate totals query. Always test the performance impact of `WITH TOTALS` in your specific use case before deploying it in a live environment.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Conclusion\n",
      "The `WITH TOTALS` modifier is a powerful tool for aggregating data and getting a quick overview of totals directly in your result set. Just keep in mind the potential performance trade-offs when working with large datasets.\n",
