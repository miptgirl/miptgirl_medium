Clarke’s Third Law says that “*any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic*”. That’s exactly how a lot of today’s AI frameworks feel. Tools like GitHub Copilot, Claude Desktop, OpenAI Operator, and Perplexity Comet are automating everyday tasks that would’ve seemed impossible to automate just five years ago. What’s even more remarkable is that with just a few lines of code, we can build our own sophisticated AI tools: ones that search through files, browse the web, click links, and even make purchases. It really does feel like magic.\\n\\nEven though I [genuinely believe in data wizards](https://towardsdatascience.com/i-think-of-analysts-as-data-wizards-who-help-their-product-teams-solve-problems/), I don’t believe in magic. I find it exciting (and often helpful) to understand how things are actually built and what’s happening under the hood. That’s why I’ve decided to share a series of posts on agentic AI design concepts that’ll help you understand how all these magical tools actually work.\\n\\nTo gain a deep understanding, we’ll build a multi-AI agent system from scratch. We’ll avoid using frameworks like CrewAI or smolagents and instead work directly with the foundation model API. Along the way, we’ll explore the fundamental agentic design patterns: reflection, tool use, planning, and multi-agent setups. Then, we’ll combine all this knowledge to build a multi-AI agent system that can answer complex data-related questions.\\n\\nAs Richard Feynman put it, “*What I cannot create, I do not understand*.” So let’s start building! In this article, we’ll focus on the reflection design pattern.

Along the way, we’ll explore the fundamental agentic design patterns: reflection, tool use, planning, and multi-agent setups. Then, we’ll combine all this knowledge to build a multi-AI agent system that can answer complex data-related questions.\n",

      "We are living in the age of AI agents. LLMs are no longer just tools. They’ve become active participants in our lives, boosting productivity and transforming the way we live and work.\n",
      "\n",
      "* OpenAI recently launched [Operator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI_Operator?utm_source=chatgpt.com), an AI agent that can autonomously perform various tasks, from browsing the web to filling out forms and scheduling appointments.\n",
      "* Anthropic introduced [MCP (Model Context Protocol)](https://www.anthropic.com/news/model-context-protocol), a new standard for how AI assistants interact with the outside world. With over five thousand active MCP servers already, adoption is growing rapidly.\n",
      "* AI agents are also changing the landscape of software engineering. Tools like GitHub Copilot’s agentic mode, Claude Code, OpenAI Codex, and others are not only [improving developer productivity and code quality](https://github.blog/news-insights/research/research-quantifying-github-copilots-impact-on-developer-productivity-and-happiness/) but also democratising the field, making software development accessible to people without a technical background.\n",
      "\n",
      "We’ve previously looked at different AI Agent frameworks, such as [LangGraph](https://towardsdatascience.com/from-basics-to-advanced-exploring-langgraph-e8c1cf4db787/) or [CrewAI](https://towardsdatascience.com/multi-ai-agent-systems-101-bac58e3bcc47/). In this article, I would like to discuss a new one I’ve been exploring recently — **HuggingFace smolagents**. It’s an interesting framework since it implements the concept of code agents.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this article, we will explore several topics:\n",
      "\n",
      "* What code agents are (*teaser: it’s not related to vibe coding*).\n",
      "* How to use the HuggingFace smolagents framework in practice.\n",
      "* Whether it’s secure to give LLMs so much agency.\n",
      "* The real difference in performance between code agents and traditional tool-calling agents.\n",
      "\n",
      "## AI Agents recap\n",
      "\n",
      "Let’s start with a quick refresher: what exactly are AI agents? HuggingFace [provides](https://huggingface.co/docs/smolagents/conceptual_guides/intro_agents) a clear and concise definition of what they mean by agents.\n",
      "\n",
      "> *AI Agents are programs where LLM outputs control the workflow.*\n",
      "\n",
      "So, we need an agentic flow when we want a system to reason and act based on observations. Actually, agency is not a binary variable (yes or no), but a spectrum.\n",
      "\n",
      "* At one end, we can have systems without agency at all, for example, a simple process where an LLM defines the sentiment of a text, translates it or summarises it.\n",
      "* The next level is routing, where an LLM can classify an incoming question and decide which path to take —  for example, calling a tool if a customer is asking about the status of their current order, and transferring the conversation to a human CS agent otherwise.\n",
      "* More advanced systems can exhibit higher degrees of agency. These might include the ability to execute other LLMs (multi-agent setup) or even create new tools on the fly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Code agents fall into this more advanced category. They are multi-step agents that execute tool calls in the form of code, in contrast to the more traditional approach using a JSON format with the tool name and arguments.\n",
      "\n",
      "Several recent papers have shown that using code in agentic flows leads to better results:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Wang, Xingyao, et al. [“Executable Code Actions Elicit Better LLM Agents”](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01030)\n",
      "* Nguyen, Dang, et al. [“DynaSaur: Large Language Agents Beyond Predefined Actions”](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01747)\n",
      "* Yang, Ke, et al. [“If LLM Is the Wizard, Then Code Is the Wand: A Survey on How Code Empowers Large Language Models to Serve as Intelligent Agents.”](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00812)\n",
      "\n",
      "It makes sense when you think about it. We’ve been developing programming languages for decades to solve complex problems. So, it’s natural that these languages are better suited to LLM’s tasks than simple JSON configs. An additional benefit is that LLMs are already quite good at writing code in common programming languages, thanks to the vast amount of available data for training.\n",
      "\n",
      "This approach comes with several other benefits as well:\n",
      "\n",
      "* By generating code, an LLM is not limited to a predefined set of tools and can create its own functions.\n",
      "* It can combine multiple tools within a single action using conditions and loops, which helps reduce the number of steps required to complete a task.\n",
      "* It also enables the model to work with a wider variety of outputs, such as generating charts, images, or other complex objects.\n",
      "\n",
      "These benefits aren’t just theoretical; we can observe them in practice. In [“Executable Code Actions Elicit Better LLM Agents”](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01030), the authors show that code agents outperform traditional methods, achieving a higher success rate and completing a task in fewer steps, which in turn reduces costs.\n",

      "I plan to use OpenAI for the model, which is accessible via [LiteLLM](https://docs.litellm.ai/). However, the framework supports other options as well. You can use a local model via [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) or [TransformersModel](https://huggingface.co/docs/smolagents/v1.15.0/en/reference/models#smolagents.TransformersModel), or public models via [Inference Providers](https://huggingface.co/blog/inference-providers) or choose other options (you can find more details in [the documentation](https://huggingface.co/docs/smolagents/guided_tour)).\n",

      "The smolagents library handles all behind-the-scenes work involved in the agent workflow: assembling the system prompt with all necessary information for the LLM (i.e. available tools), parsing the output and executing the generated code. It also provides comprehensive logging and a retry mechanism to help correct mistakes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, the library offers memory management features. By default, all execution results are saved to memory, but you can customise this behaviour. For example, you can remove some intermediary results from the memory to reduce the number of tokens or execute the agent step-by-step.

      "In [the previous article](https://medium.com/towards-data-science/can-llms-replace-data-analysts-building-an-llm-powered-analyst-851578fa10ce), we’ve started building an LLM-powered analyst. We decided to focus on descriptive analytics and reporting tasks since they are the most common for analysts. Most analysts start their careers with such tasks, and most companies start building the analytical function with reporting and BI tools.\n",
      "\n",

      "The next step would be to teach our LLM-powered analyst to get any metrics. Analysts usually use SQL to get data. So, the most helpful skill for the LLM analyst would be interacting with SQL databases.\n",
      "\n",
      "We’ve already discussed OpenAI functions and learned how LLMs can use tools to integrate with the world. In this article, I would like to focus on LLM agents and discuss them in more detail. We will learn how to build agents using LangChain and try different agent types.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Setting up a database\n",
      "\n",
      "First, let’s set up a database we will be interacting with. My choice is ClickHouse. ClickHouse is an open-source column-oriented SQL database management system for online analytical processing (OLAP). It’s a good option for big data and analytical tasks.\n",

      "\n",
      "Installing ClickHouse is just one line of code. The initial command executes the script provided by the ClickHouse team to download the proper binary for your platform. Then, you need to launch a server, and that’s it.\n",
      "\n",
      "```wp-block-prismatic-blocks\n",
      "curl https://clickhouse.com/ | sh # downloads appropriate binary file\n",
      "./clickhouse server # starts clickhouse server\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "You can access ClickHouse via HTTP API. By default, it listens on the 8123 port.\n",
      "\n",
      "```wp-block-prismatic-blocks\n",
      "CH_HOST = 'http://localhost:8123' # default address \n",
      "\n",
      "def get_clickhouse_data(query, host = CH_HOST, connection_timeout = 1500):\n",
      "    r = requests.post(host, params = {'query': query}, \n",
      "      timeout = connection_timeout)\n",
      "\n",
      "    return r.text\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "I usually check that `r.status_code = 200` to ensure the request has been successfully completed and raise the error otherwise. However, we will pass the results of this function to LLM. So, getting any output DB returns is okay, regardless of whether it is an error or not. LLM will be able to handle it properly.\n",
      "\n",
      "I’ve generated synthetic data for this example. If you would like to learn more about data simulation, you can find the code [here](https://github.com/miptgirl/miptgirl_medium/blob/main/analyst_agent/generate_synthetic_data_for_sql.ipynb). I used retention curves to model sessions for customers, considering the number of days since account creation and weekly seasonality.

      "\n",
      "## Agents overview\n",
      "\n",
      "The core idea of the LLM agents is to use LLM as a reasoning engine to define the set of actions to take. In the classic approach, we hardcode a sequence of actions, but with agents, we give the model tools and tasks and let her decide how to achieve them.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the most foundational papers regarding LLM agents is [\"ReAct: Synergizing Reasoning and Acting in Language Models\"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03629) by Shunyu Yao et al. The ReAct (**Re**asoning + **Act**ing) approach suggests combining:\n",
      "\n",
      "* reasoning that helps to create the plan and update it in case of exceptions,\n",
      "* actions that allow the model to leverage external tools or gather data from external sources.\n",
      "\n",
      "Such an approach shows much better performance on different tasks. One of the examples from the paper is below.\n",
      "\n",
      "![Example from the paper by Yao et al.](https://towardsdatascience.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1c4RvVptH0A04B5ffzGjliQ.png)\n",
      "\n",
      "Example from [the paper by Yao et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03629)\n",
      "\n",
      "Actually, that’s how human intelligence works: we combine inner voice reasoning with task-oriented actions. Suppose you need to cook a dinner. You will use reasoning to define a plan (\"guests will be in 30 minutes, I have time only to cook pasta\"), adjust it (\"Ben has become a vegan, I should order something for him\") or decide to delegate which is an equivalent of external tools (\"there’s no pasta left, I need to ask my partner to buy it\"). At the same time, you will use actioning to use some tools (ask a partner for help or use a mixer) or get some information (to look up in the internet how many minutes you need to cook pasta to make it al dente). So, it’s reasonable to use a similar approach with LLMs since it works for humans (who are no doubt AGI).\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, there are quite a lot of different approaches for LLM agents since ReAct. They differ in prompts used to set the model’s reasoning, how we define tools, output format, handling memory about the intermediate steps, etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some of the most popular approaches are:\n",
      "\n",
      "* OpenAI functions,\n",
      "* AutoGPT,\n",
      "* BabyAGI,\n",
      "* Plan-and-execute agent.\n",
      "\n",
      "We will use these approaches later on for our task and see how they work and what the differences are.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Building Agent from Scratch\n",
      "\n",
      "Let’s start to build an agent. We will do it from scratch to understand how everything works under the hood. Then, we will use LangChain’s tools for faster prototyping if you don’t need any customisation.\n",
      "\n",
      "The core components of LLM agents are:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Prompt to guide the model’s reasoning.\n",
      "* Tools that the model can use.\n",
      "* Memory – a mechanism to pass previous iterations to the model.\n",
      "\n",
      "For the first version of the LLM agent, we will use OpenAI functions as a framework to build an agent.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Defining tools\n",
      "\n",
      "Let’s start with defining the tools for our robot. Let’s think about what information our LLM-powered analyst might need to be able to answer questions:\n",
      "\n",
      "* List of tables – we can put it in the system prompt so that the model has some view on what data we have and doesn’t need to execute a tool for it every time,\n",
      "* List of columns for the table so that the model can understand the data schema,\n",
      "* Top values for the column in the table so that the model can look up values for filters,\n",
      "* Results of SQL query execution to be able to get actual data.\n",
      "\n",
      "To define tools in LangChain, we need to use `@tool` decorator for the function. We will use Pydantic to specify the arguments schema for each function so that the model knows what to pass to the function.\n",
      "\n",
      "We’ve discussed tools and OpenAI functions in detail in [the previous article](https://medium.com/towards-data-science/can-llms-replace-data-analysts-building-an-llm-powered-analyst-851578fa10ce). So don’t hesitate to read it if you need to revise this topic.\n",

First, it’s rather challenging and fun. Second, it will help us to look at our work in a more structured way. Third, it will give us an opportunity to try in practice one of the most cutting-edge approaches – LLM agents.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this article, we will start simple and learn how LLMs can leverage tools and do straightforward tasks. But in the following articles, we will dive deeper into different approaches and best practices for LLM agents.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, let the journey begin.\n",
      "\n",
      "## What is data analytics?\n",
      "\n",
      "Before moving on to the LLMs, let’s try defining what analytics is and what tasks we do as analysts.\n",
      "\n",
      "My motto is that the goal of the analytical team is to help the product teams make the right decisions based on data in the available time. It’s a good mission, but to define the scope of the LLM-powered analyst, we should decompose the analytical work further.\n",
      "\n",
      "I like [the framework](https://www.gartner.com/en/topics/data-and-analytics) proposed by Gartner. It identifies four different Data and Analytics techniques:\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Descriptive analytics** answers questions like \"What happened?\". For example, what was the revenue in December? This approach includes reporting tasks and working with BI tools.\n",
      "* **Diagnostic analytics** goes a bit further and asks questions like \"Why did something happen?\". For example, why revenue decreased by 10% compared to the previous year? This technique requires more drill-down and slicing & dicing of your data.\n",
      "* **Predictive analytics** allows us to get answers to questions like \"What will happen?\". The two cornerstones of this approach are forecasting (predicting the future for business-as-usual situations) and simulation (modelling different possible outcomes).\n",
      "* **Prescriptive analytics** impacts the final decisions. The common questions are \"What should we focus on?\" or \"How could we increase volume by 10%?\".\n",
      "\n",
      "Usually, companies go through all these stages step by step. It’s almost impossible to start looking at forecasts and different scenario analyses if your company hasn’t mastered descriptive analytics yet (you don’t have a data warehouse, BI tools, or metrics definitions). So, this framework can also show the company’s data maturity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Similarly, when an analyst grows from junior to senior level, she will likely go through all these stages, starting from well-defined reporting tasks and progressing to vague strategic questions. So, this framework is relevant on an individual level as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "If we return to our LLM-powered analyst, we should focus on descriptive analytics and reporting tasks. It’s better to start from the basics. So, we will focus on learning LLM to understand the basic questions about data.\n",
      "\n",
      "We’ve defined our focus for the first prototype. So, we are ready to move on to the technical questions and discuss the concept of LLM agents and tools.\n",
      "\n",
      "## LLM agents and tools\n",
      "\n",
      "When we were using LLMs before (for example, to do topic modelling [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/topic-modelling-in-production-e3b3e99e4fca?source=your_stories_page-------------------------------------)), we described the exact steps ourselves in the code. For example, let’s look at the chain below. Firstly, we asked the model to determine the sentiment for a customer review. Then, depending on the sentiment, extract from the review either the advantages or disadvantages mentioned in the text.\n",
      "\n",
      "![Illustration by author](https://towardsdatascience.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1D4ZM46STZ-S_yf39-q4y_g.png)\n",
      "\n",
      "Illustration by author\n",
      "\n",
      "In this example, we clearly defined the LLM’s behaviour, and the LLM solved this task pretty well. However, this approach won’t work if we build something more high-level and vague, like an LLM-powered analyst.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you’ve ever worked as or with an analyst for at least one day, you would know that analysts are getting a vast range of different questions and asks, starting from basic questions (like \"How many customers did we have on our site yesterday?\" or \"Could you make a graph for our Board meeting tomorrow?\") to very high-level ones (for example, \"What are the main customer pain points?\" or \"What market should we launch next?\"). It goes without saying it’s not feasible to describe all possible scenarios.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, there’s an approach that could help us – agents. The core idea of the agents is to use LLMs as a reasoning engine that could choose what to do next and when it’s time to return the final answer to the customer. It sounds pretty close to our behaviour: we get a task, define needed tools, use them, and then come back with the final answer when ready.\n",
      "\n",
      "The essential concept related to agents (that I’ve already mentioned above) is tools. Tools are functions that LLM could invoke to get missing information (for example, execute SQL, use a calculator or call a search engine). Tools are crucial because they allow you to bring LLMs to the next level and interact with the world. In this article, we will primarily focus on OpenAI functions as tools.\n",
      "\n",
      "OpenAI has fine-tuned models to be able to work with functions so that:\n",
      "\n",
      "* You can pass to the model the list of functions with descriptions;\n",
      "* If it’s relevant to your query, the model will return you a function call – function name and input parameters to call it.\n",
      "\n",
      "You can find more info and the up-to-date list of models that support functions in [the documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/function-calling).\n",
      "\n",
      "There are two prominent use cases to use functions with LLMs:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Tagging & extraction – in these cases, functions are used to ensure the output format of the model. Instead of the usual output with content, you will get a structured function call.\n",
      "* Tools & routing – this is a more exciting use case that allows you to create an agent.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let’s start with the more straightforward use case of extraction to learn how to use OpenAI functions.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Use Case #1: Tagging & Extraction\n",
      "\n",
      "You might wonder what is the difference between tagging and extraction. These terms are pretty close. The only difference is whether the model extracts info presented in the text or labels the text providing new information (i.e. defines language or sentiment).\n",
      "\n",
      "![Illustration by author](https://towardsdatascience.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/13UhwvtqKSdcPk0n3qpf4HQ.png)\n",
      "\n",
      "Illustration by author\n",
      "\n",
      "Since we’ve decided to focus on descriptive analytics and reporting tasks, let’s use this approach to structure incoming data requests and pull the following components: metrics, dimensions, filters, period and desired output.\n",

      "  dimensions: Optional[str] = Field(description = \"parameters to split your metric by\")\n",

      "\n",
      "## 1. **LLM Agents and Agentic AI**\n",
      "The article introduces **LLM agents** as a paradigm shift from predefined workflows to autonomous reasoning systems. Instead of hardcoding every step, agents use LLMs as a \"reasoning engine\" to dynamically choose actions and determine when to return final answers—mirroring how human analysts work.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 2. **Tool-Using LLMs (Function Calling)**\n",
      "The article focuses on **OpenAI function calling** as a critical capability that allows LLMs to interact with external systems. This enables LLMs to invoke tools like SQL executors, calculators, or search engines, bridging the gap between language models and real-world data systems.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 3. **Structured Output via Function Calling**\n",
      "Two key use cases for functions are highlighted:\n",
      "- **Tagging & Extraction**: Using function calls to ensure structured, validated output formats instead of unstructured text\n",
      "- **Tools & Routing**: Enabling agent-like behavior where LLMs can select and execute appropriate tools\n",
      "\n",
      "## 4. **Pydantic for Schema Definition**\n",
      "The article demonstrates using **Pydantic** (a Python data validation library) combined with **LangChain utilities** to define function schemas more elegantly than raw JSON, improving developer experience and maintainability.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 5. **Practical AI Automation Framework**\n",
      "The article applies Gartner's analytics maturity framework (descriptive → diagnostic → predictive → prescriptive) to scope LLM capabilities, advocating for starting with **descriptive analytics** tasks before attempting more complex autonomous decision-making.\u001b[0m\n",

      "Article Content (excerpt):\n",
      "As product analysts, we often need to investigate what’s going on with KPIs: whether we’re reacting to anomalies on our dashboards or just routinely doing a numbers update. Based on my years of experience as a KPI analyst, I would estimate that more than 80% of these tasks are fairly standard and can be solved just by following a simple checklist.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here’s a high-level plan for investigating a KPI change (*you can find more details in the article* [*“Anomaly Root Cause Analysis 101”*](https://towardsdatascience.com/anomaly-root-cause-analysis-101-98f63dd12016/)):\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Estimate the top-line change in the metric** to understand the magnitude of the shift.\n",
      "* **Check data quality** to ensure that the numbers are accurate and reliable.\n",
      "* **Gather context** about internal and external events that might have influenced the change.\n",
      "* **Slice and dice the metric** to identify which segments are contributing to the metric’s shift.\n",
      "* **Consolidate your findings in an executive summary** that includes hypotheses and estimates of their impacts on the main KPI.\n",

      "Since we have a clear plan to execute, such tasks can potentially be automated using AI agents. The code agents we recently [discussed](https://towardsdatascience.com/code-agents-the-future-of-agentic-ai/) could be a good fit there, as their ability to write and execute code will help them to analyse data efficiently, with minimal back-and-forth. So, let’s try building such an agent using the HuggingFace smolagents framework.\n",

      "[LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/) is one of the leading frameworks for building applications powered by Lardge Language Models. With the [LangChain Expression Language](https://python.langchain.com/v0.1/docs/expression_language/) (LCEL), defining and executing step-by-step action sequences – also known as chains – becomes much simpler. In more technical terms, LangChain allows us to create DAGs (directed acyclic graphs).\n",
      "\n",
      "As LLM applications, particularly LLM agents, have evolved, we’ve begun to use LLMs not just for execution but also as reasoning engines. This shift has introduced interactions that frequently involve repetition (cycles) and complex conditions. In such scenarios, LCEL is not sufficient, so LangChain implemented a new module – [LangGraph](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/).\n",
      "\n",
      "LangGraph (as you might guess from the name) models all interactions as cyclical graphs. These graphs enable the development of advanced workflows and interactions with multiple loops and if-statements, making it a handy tool for creating both agent and multi-agent workflows.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this article, I will explore LangGraph’s key features and capabilities, including multi-agent applications. We’ll build a system that can answer different types of questions and dive into how to implement a human-in-the-loop setup.\n",
      "\n",
      "In [the previous article](https://medium.com/towards-data-science/multi-ai-agent-systems-101-bac58e3bcc47), we tried using CrewAI, another popular framework for multi-agent systems. LangGraph, however, takes a different approach. While CrewAI is a high-level framework with many predefined features and ready-to-use components, LangGraph operates at a lower level, offering extensive customization and control.\n",
      "\n",
      "With that introduction, let’s dive into the fundamental concepts of LangGraph.\n",
      "\n",
      "## LangGraph basics\n",
      "\n",
      "LangGraph is part of the LangChain ecosystem, so we will continue using well-known concepts like prompt templates, tools, etc. However, LangGraph brings a bunch of [additional concepts.](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/low_level/#compiling-your-graph) Let’s discuss them.\n",
      "\n",
      "LangGraph is created to define cyclical graphs. Graphs consist of the following elements:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Nodes represent actual actions and can be either LLMs, agents or functions. Also, a special END node marks the end of execution.\n",
      "* Edges connect nodes and determine the execution flow of your graph. There are basic edges that simply link one node to another and conditional edges that incorporate if-statements and additional logic.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another important concept is the state of the graph. The state serves as a foundational element for collaboration among the graph’s components. It represents a snapshot of the graph that any part – whether nodes or edges – can access and modify during execution to retrieve or update information.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, the state plays a crucial role in persistence. It is automatically saved after each step, allowing you to pause and resume execution at any point. This feature supports the development of more complex applications, such as those requiring error correction or incorporating human-in-the-loop interactions.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Single-agent workflow\n",
      "\n",
      "### Building agent from scratch\n",
      "\n",
      "Let’s start simple and try using LangGraph for a basic use case – an agent with tools.\n",
      "\n",
      "I will try to build similar applications to those we did with CrewAI in [the previous article](https://medium.com/towards-data-science/multi-ai-agent-systems-101-bac58e3bcc47). Then, we will be able to compare the two frameworks. For this example, let’s create an application that can automatically generate documentation based on the table in the database. It can save us quite a lot of time when creating documentation for our data sources.\n",
      "\n",
      "As usual, we will start by defining the tools for our agent. Since I will use the ClickHouse database in this example, I’ve defined a function to execute any query. You can use a different database if you prefer, as we won’t rely on any database-specific features.\n",
      "\n",
      "```wp-block-prismatic-blocks\n",
      "CH_HOST = 'http://localhost:8123' # default address \n",
      "import requests\n",
      "\n",
      "def get_clickhouse_data(query, host = CH_HOST, connection_timeout = 1500):\n",
      "  r = requests.post(host, params = {'query': query}, \n",
      "    timeout = connection_timeout)\n",
      "  if r.status_code == 200:\n",
      "      return r.text\n",
      "  else: \n",
      "      return 'Database returned the following error:n' + r.text\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "It’s crucial to make LLM tools reliable and error-prone. If a database returns an error, I provide this feedback to the LLM rather than throwing an exception and halting execution. Then, the LLM agent will have an opportunity to fix an error and call the function again.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let’s define one tool named `execute_sql` , which enables the execution of any SQL query. We use `pydantic` to specify the tool’s structure, ensuring that the LLM agent has all the needed information to use the tool effectively.\n",
      "\n",
      "```wp-block-prismatic-blocks\n",
      "from langchain_core.tools import tool\n",
      "from pydantic.v1 import BaseModel, Field\n",
      "from typing import Optional\n",
      "\n",
      "class SQLQuery(BaseModel):\n",
      "  query: str = Field(description=\"SQL query to execute\")\n",
      "\n",
      "@tool(args_schema = SQLQuery)\n",
      "def execute_sql(query: str) -> str:\n",
      "  \"\"\"Returns the result of SQL query execution\"\"\"\n",
      "  return get_clickhouse_data(query)\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "We can print the parameters of the created tool to see what information is passed to LLM.\n",
      "\n",
      "```wp-block-prismatic-blocks\n",
      "print(f'''\n",
      "name: {execute_sql.name}\n",
      "description: {execute_sql.description}\n",
      "arguments: {execute_sql.args}\n",
      "''')\n",

      "# arguments: {'query': {'title': 'Query', 'description': \n",
      "#   'SQL query to execute', 'type': 'string'}}\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "Everything looks good. We’ve set up the necessary tool and can now move on to defining an LLM agent. As we discussed above, the cornerstone of the agent in LangGraph is its state, which enables the sharing of information between different parts of our graph.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our current example is relatively straightforward. So, we will only need to store the history of messages. Let’s define the agent state.\n",
      "\n",
      "```wp-block-prismatic-blocks\n",
      "# useful imports\n",
      "from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, END\n",
      "from typing import TypedDict, Annotated\n",
      "import operator\n",
      "from langchain_core.messages import AnyMessage, SystemMessage, HumanMessage, ToolMessage\n",
      "\n",
      "# defining agent state\n",
      "class AgentState(TypedDict):\n",
      "   messages: Annotated[list[AnyMessage], operator.add]\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "We’ve defined a single parameter in `AgentState` – `messages` – which is a list of objects of the class `AnyMessage` . Additionally, we annotated it with `operator.add` (reducer). This annotation ensures that each time a node returns a message, it is appended to the existing list in the state. Without this operator, each new message would replace the previous value rather than being added to the list.\n",
      "\n",
      "The next step is to define the agent itself. Let’s start with `__init__` function. We will specify three arguments for the agent: model, list of tools and system prompt.\n",
      "\n",
      "```wp-block-prismatic-blocks\n",
      "class SQLAgent:\n",
      "  # initialising the object\n",

      "    self.graph = graph.compile()\n",
      "    self.tools = {t.name: t for t in tools}\n",
      "    self.model = model.bind_tools(tools)\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "In the initialisation function, we’ve outlined the structure of our graph, which includes two nodes: `llm` and `action`. Nodes are actual actions, so we have functions associated with them. We will define functions a bit later.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, we have one conditional edge that determines whether we need to execute the function or generate the final answer. For this edge, we need to specify the previous node (in our case, `llm`), a function that decides the next step, and mapping of the subsequent steps based on the function’s output (formatted as a dictionary). If `exists_function_calling` returns True, we follow to the function node. Otherwise, execution will conclude at the special `END` node, which marks the end of the process.\n",
      "\n",
      "We’ve added an edge between `function` and `llm`. It just links these two steps and will be executed without any conditions.\n",
      "\n",
      "With the main structure defined, it’s time to create all the functions outlined above. The first one is `call_llm`. This function will execute LLM and return the result.\n",
      "\n",
      "The agent state will be passed to the function automatically so we can use the saved system prompt and model from it.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Article Content (excerpt):\n",
      "Arthur C. Clarke’s Third Law says that “*any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic*”. That’s exactly how a lot of today’s AI frameworks feel. Tools like GitHub Copilot, Claude Desktop, OpenAI Operator, and Perplexity Comet are automating everyday tasks that would’ve seemed impossible to automate just five years ago. What’s even more remarkable is that with just a few lines of code, we can build our own sophisticated AI tools: ones that search through files, browse the web, click links, and even make purchases. It really does feel like magic.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even though I [genuinely believe in data wizards](https://towardsdatascience.com/i-think-of-analysts-as-data-wizards-who-help-their-product-teams-solve-problems/), I don’t believe in magic. I find it exciting (and often helpful) to understand how things are actually built and what’s happening under the hood. That’s why I’ve decided to share a series of posts on agentic AI design concepts that’ll help you understand how all these magical tools actually work.\n",
      "\n",
      "To gain a deep understanding, we’ll build a multi-AI agent system from scratch. We’ll avoid using frameworks like CrewAI or smolagents and instead work directly with the foundation model API. Along the way, we’ll explore the fundamental agentic design patterns: reflection, tool use, planning, and multi-agent setups. Then, we’ll combine all this knowledge to build a multi-AI agent system that can answer complex data-related questions.\n",
      "\n",
      "As Richard Feynman put it, “*What I cannot create, I do not understand*.” So let’s start building! In this article, we’ll focus on the reflection design pattern. But first, let’s figure out what exactly reflection is.\n",
      "\n",
      "## What reflection is\n",
      "\n",
      "Let’s reflect on how we (humans) usually work on tasks. Imagine I need to share the results of a recent feature launch with my PM. I’ll likely put together a quick draft and then read it once or twice from beginning to end, ensuring that all parts are consistent, there’s enough information, and there are no typos.\n",
      "\n",
      "Or let’s take another example: writing a SQL query. I’ll either write it step by step, checking the intermediate results along the way, or (if it’s simple enough) I’ll draft it all at once, execute it, look at the result (checking for errors or whether the result matches my expectations), and then tweak the query based on that feedback. I might rerun it, check the result, and iterate until it’s right.\n",
      "\n",
      "So we rarely write long texts from top to bottom in one go. We usually circle back, review, and tweak as we go. These feedback loops are what help us improve the quality of our work.\n",
      "\n",

      "LLMs use a different approach. If you ask an LLM a question, by default, it will generate an answer token by token, and the LLM won’t be able to review its result and fix any issues. But in an agentic AI setup, we can create feedback loops for LLMs too, either by asking the LLM to review and improve its own answer or by sharing external feedback with it (like the results of a SQL execution). And that’s the whole point of reflection. It sounds pretty straightforward, but it can yield significantly better results.\n",

      "\n",
      "Reflection is especially impactful in agentic systems because it can be used to course-correct at many steps of the process:\n",
      "\n",
      "* When a user asks a question, the LLM can use reflection to evaluate whether the request is feasible.\n",
      "* When the LLM puts together an initial plan, it can use reflection to double-check whether the plan makes sense and can help achieve the goal.\n",
      "* After each execution step or tool call, the agent can evaluate whether it’s on track and whether it’s worth adjusting the plan.\n",
      "* When the plan is fully executed, the agent can reflect to see whether it has actually accomplished the goal and solved the task.\n",
      "\n",
      "It’s clear that reflection can significantly improve accuracy. However, there are trade-offs worth discussing. Reflection might require multiple additional calls to the LLM and potentially other systems, which can lead to increased latency and costs. So in business cases, it’s worth considering whether the quality improvements justify the expenses and delays in the user flow.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Reflection in frameworks\n",
      "\n",
      "Since there’s no doubt that reflection brings value to AI agents, it’s widely used in popular frameworks. Let’s look at some examples.\n",
      "\n",
      "The idea of reflection was first proposed in the paper [“ReAct: Synergizing Reasoning and Acting in Language Models”](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03629) by Yao et al. (2022). ReAct is a framework that combines interleaving stages of Reasoning (reflection through explicit thought traces) and Acting (task-relevant actions in an environment). In this framework, reasoning guides the choice of actions, and actions produce new observations that inform further reasoning. The reasoning stage itself is a combination of reflection and planning.\n",
      "\n",
      "This framework became quite popular, so there are now several off-the-shelf implementations, such as:\n",
      "\n",
      "* The [**DSPy**](https://dspy.ai/api/modules/ReAct/) framework by Databricks has a `ReAct` class,\n",
      "* In [**LangGraph**](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/agents/agents/#1-install-dependencies), you can use the `create_react_agent` function,\n",
      "* Code agents in the [**smolagents**](https://huggingface.co/docs/smolagents/conceptual_guides/react) library by HuggingFace are also based on the ReAct architecture.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Reflection from scratch\n",
      "\n",
      "Now that we’ve learned the theory and explored existing implementations, it’s time to get our hands dirty and build something ourselves. In the ReAct approach, agents use reflection at each step, combining planning with reflection. However, to understand the impact of reflection more clearly, we’ll look at it in isolation.\n",
      "\n",
      "As an example, we’ll use text-to-SQL: we’ll give an LLM a question and expect it to return a valid SQL query. We’ll be working with [a flight delay dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hrishitpatil/flight-data-2024) and the ClickHouse SQL dialect.\n",
      "\n",
      "We’ll start by using direct generation without any reflection as our baseline. Then, we’ll try using reflection by asking the model to critique and improve the SQL, or by providing it with additional feedback. After that, we’ll measure the quality of our answers to see whether reflection actually leads to better results.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Direct generation\n",

      "We’ll begin with the most straightforward approach, direct generation, where we ask the LLM to generate SQL that answers a user query.\n",

      "## 1. **Agentic AI and Reflection Design Pattern**\n",
      "The core focus is on **reflection** as a fundamental agentic design pattern where LLMs iteratively review and improve their outputs through feedback loops, mimicking human work processes. This enables AI agents to self-critique and refine results rather than generating responses in a single pass.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 2. **Building AI Systems from First Principles**\n",
      "A trend toward understanding AI tools \"from scratch\" rather than relying solely on high-level frameworks. The article advocates working directly with foundation model APIs to gain deeper understanding of how agentic systems actually work.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 3. **Self-Correction and Iterative Refinement Techniques**\n",
      "Key methodologies cited include:\n",
      "- **Self-Refine** (self-feedback loops)\n",
      "- **Reflexion** (verbal reinforcement learning)\n",
      "- **CRITIC** (tool-interactive critiquing with external feedback)\n",
      "- **ReAct** (combining reasoning and acting)\n",
      "\n",
      "These approaches show 10-30% performance improvements across diverse tasks.\n",

      "## 4. **Popular Agentic AI Frameworks**\n",
      "Mentioned tools and frameworks include: GitHub Copilot, Claude Desktop, OpenAI Operator, Perplexity Comet, CrewAI, smolagents, DSPy, and LangGraph.\n",
      "\n",

      "Article Title: Beyond Prompting: The Power of Context Engineering\n",
      "\n",
      "Article Content (excerpt):\n",
      "Context is everything an LLM can see before it generates an answer. This includes the prompt itself, instructions, examples, retrieved documents, tool outputs, and even the prior conversation history.\n",
      "\n",
      "Context has a huge impact on answer quality. For example, if you ask an LLM to write a SQL query without providing the data schema, the result will almost certainly be suboptimal. Worse, if the model has no access to the database at all, it may simply hallucinate a query that doesn’t work. Even when tools are available, the model still needs extra time and effort to infer the schema before it can produce a correct answer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Because context plays such a central role in LLM-based applications, context engineering has emerged as a discipline focused on systematically optimising what information goes into a model’s prompt. The goal is to build “self-improving” systems that learn from experience without relying on expensive fine-tuning (retraining models and updating millions of parameters).\n",
      "\n",
      "Context engineering comes with several key advantages:\n",
      "\n",
      "* it’s more cost-effective and doesn’t require specialised fine-tuning expertise;\n",
      "* context and instructions remain transparent, interpretable, and easy for humans to modify;\n",
      "* iteration cycles are much faster, since updates can be made instantly without retraining or redeploying models;\n",
      "* it’s more agile, especially when information needs to be forgotten for privacy or legal reasons.\n",
      "\n",
      "With all these advantages, it’s not surprising that context engineering is gaining so much attention. What’s interesting, though, is how quickly the approaches themselves are evolving. In this article, I’ll walk through that evolution and then experiment with one of the newer frameworks for prompt optimisation: Agentic Context Engineering (ACE).\n",
      "\n",
      "## Evolution of context engineering approaches\n",
      "\n",
      "Context engineering didn’t appear overnight. It has evolved through several distinct stages.\n",
      "\n",
      "The earliest stage was static prompting.Here, prompts were hand-crafted instructions that never changed. Most of the effort went into classic prompt engineering: carefully choosing wording, structure, and formatting to squeeze better performance out of the model.\n",
      "\n",
      "The next major step was dynamic retrieval. Instead of relying on a fixed prompt, systems began pulling in relevant information (documents, examples, or facts) at inference time. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) became one of the most popular approaches in this category. By grounding responses in external data, RAG significantly improved accuracy and reduced hallucinations, especially for knowledge-heavy tasks.\n",
      "\n",
      "More recently, the focus has shifted toward self-improving contexts.Rather than treating context as something that is merely retrieved or injected, these approaches allow the system to update and refine its own context based on past performance. In other words, the prompt itself becomes adaptive, evolving through reflection and feedback.\n",
      "\n",
      "A number of frameworks have emerged around this idea. Below are some of the most influential ones.\n",
      "\n",
      "* One of the earliest and most significant works is[**“**Reflexion: Language Agents with Verbal Reinforcement Learning”](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11366) by Shinn et al. This research introduced the idea that language agents can learn from mistakes through natural language reflection rather than gradient-based updates. Reflexion agents analyse feedback from previous attempts, generate verbal reflections about what went wrong, and store these reflections in an episodic memory buffer. These stored reflections then guide better decision-making in subsequent trials.\n",
      "* Another important contribution is [“TextGrad: Automatic Differentiation via Text”](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07496) by Yuksekgonul et al. TextGrad borrows concepts from deep learning optimisation (such as gradients, backpropagation, and gradient descent) but replaces numerical derivatives with natural language feedback. In this framework, LLMs generate textual critiques describing how a variable should change to improve the outcome. These “textual gradients” are then propagated backwards through the system using prompting, effectively performing a natural-language version of backpropagation across a compound AI system.\n",
      "* The paper [“GEPA: Reflective Prompt Evolution Can Outperform Reinforcement Learning”](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19457) by Agrawal et al. takes a different angle by combining evolutionary algorithms with language-based reflection. Prompts are treated like organisms: they mutate, compete, and evolve under selection pressure. Over time, better-performing prompts survive and propagate. This approach is implemented in [DSPy](https://towardsdatascience.com/programming-not-prompting-a-hands-on-guide-to-dspy/), and Hugging Face provides [a practical guide](https://huggingface.co/learn/cookbook/dspy_gepa) for applying it in real-world use cases.\n",
      "* Finally, [“Dynamic Cheatsheet: Test-Time Learning with Adaptive Memory”](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07952) by Suzgun et al. explores test-time learning through persistent memory. In this setup, a black-box LLM is given a notebook where it can write down useful strategies, patterns, and code snippets during inference. Instead of repeatedly rediscovering the same insights, the model accumulates and reuses knowledge across tasks. This adaptive memory significantly improves performance without requiring explicit labels or human feedback.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Agentic Context Engineering\n",
      "\n",
      "Now that we’ve covered how context engineering has evolved, let’s take a closer look at Agentic Context Engineering (ACE)**,** one of the more recent approaches and the main focus of this article. ACE is introduced in the paper [“Agentic Context Engineering: Evolving Contexts for Self-Improving Language Models”](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04618) by Zhang et al., published in 2025.\n",
      "\n",
      "The paper starts by identifying two key problems with existing self-improving context methods.\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Brevity bias** isthe tendency for systems to oversimplify important details and gradually collapse toward short, generic prompts. While compact prompts are attractive, they often lose the nuances that actually drive good performance.\n",
      "* **Context collapse.** When systems repeatedly rewrite the entire prompt, they tend to forget useful knowledge accumulated earlier. Over time, this leads to instability and regressions rather than steady improvement.\n",
      "\n",
      "To address these issues, the authors propose Agentic Context Engineering (ACE), a framework designed for scalable and efficient context adaptation in both offline settings (such as system prompt optimisation) and online scenarios (like test-time memory adaptation). Instead of compressing knowledge into a single static prompt, ACE allows the model to continuously evolve its context by accumulating successful strategies, reflecting on failures, and organising knowledge in a structured way. Conceptually, it resembles an AI assistant that improves over time by keeping detailed notes and refining its own playbook.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the core of ACE is an agentic learning loop that mirrors how humans learn through experimentation: try, reflect, and consolidate. The framework consists of three components:\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Generator**, which produces reasoning trajectories while solving tasks;\n",
      "* **Reflector**, which analyses successes and failures and distils actionable insights;\n",
      "* **Curator**, which integrates those insights into the shared context as small, incremental updates.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rather than maintaining a single monolithic prompt, ACE organises context as a playbook made up of structured bullet points. Each bullet contains metadata (such as a unique identifier and counters tracking how often it has been helpful or harmful) as well as content representing a small, reusable unit of knowledge. This might be a general strategy, a domain-specific concept, or a common failure mode.\n",

      "Figure from the paper Zhang et al, 2025 | [source](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04618)\n",
      "\n",
      "The ACE workflow consists of several phases.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Generation phase.** The Generator tackles new problems using the current playbook, marking which bullets were helpful or misleading.\n",
      "2. **Reflection phase.** The Reflector analyses the full trajectory, extracting lessons from both successes and failures through iterative refinement.\n",
      "3. **Curation phase.** The Curator turns these insights into compact “delta” updates — new or modified bullets that are merged into the existing playbook using lightweight, non-LLM logic.\n",
      "4. **Grow-and-refine phase.** New bullets are appended, existing ones are updated in place, and periodic deduplication removes redundancy using semantic embeddings.\n",
      "\n",
      "This design enables parallel processing of multiple updates and supports multi-epoch adaptation, where the same queries can be revisited to progressively strengthen the context over time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Empirically, ACE delivers strong results. On benchmark evaluations, it outperforms other self-improving context approaches, achieving a +10.6% improvement on AI agent tasks and a +8.6% gain in specialised domains such as finance.\n",

      "Beyond accuracy, ACE is also more cost-efficient thanks to its incremental update mechanism, showing 83.6% lower token costs compared to baseline methods.\n",
      "\n",
      "Together, these results position ACE as a practical and scalable step forward in building self-improving LLM systems.\n",

      "## Using ACE for banking intent data\n",
      "\n",
      "The ACE framework looks promising on paper, so the next step is to see how it performs in practice. Fortunately, the authors have shared an open-source implementation on [GitHub](https://github.com/ace-agent/ace), which gives us a solid starting point.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Loading the data\n",
      "\n",
      "To keep the experiment focused, I decided to apply ACE to a classification task. I’m using a [publicly available dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/PolyAI/banking77) of banking intents released by PolyAI (CC BY 4.0). This dataset reflects a very common real-world problem: identifying customer intent when someone contacts customer support. Accurate intent classification is critical for routing requests to the right team, triggering semi-automated responses, or simply monitoring recurring issues.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this dataset, each customer message (for example, *“I’m not sure why my card didn’t work”)* needs to be mapped to a specific banking intent, such as `declined_card_payment`. In total, there are 77 distinct intent categories.\n",
      "\n",
      "To keep the experiment manageable, I sampled 500 examples from the dataset and split them into training, test, and validation sets. Below is the code used to load the data and create the splits.\n",
      "\n",
      "```wp-block-prismatic-blocks\n",

      "### Extending ACE to banking intent data\n",
      "\n",
      "The next step is to extend the ACE framework so it can work with our banking intent dataset. Fortunately, the authors provide a [detailed guide](https://github.com/ace-agent/ace/blob/main/EXTENDING_ACE.md) that makes this process relatively straightforward.\n",
      "\n",
      "> *In addition to plugging in the new dataset, I made a couple of small modifications to the core framework to support Anthropic models and configurable temperature settings. You can find the complete, modified version of the code on [GitHub](https://github.com/miptgirl/ace).*\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Preparing the data\n",
      "\n",
      "The first thing we need to do is prepare the dataset in a format that ACE expects. I saved the training, validation, and test splits as CSV files under `banking/data`. Each example contains:\n",
      "\n",
      "* `text`: the customer support message,\n",
      "* `category`: the target intent label we want to predict,\n",
      "* `group`: an auxiliary field indicating whether the example belongs to the train, test, or validation set.\n",
      "\n",
      "The `group` field won’t be used later by the framework itself, but it’s convenient for dataset management and reproducibility.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here’s what the data format looks like.\n",
      "\n",
      "```wp-block-prismatic-blocks\n",

      "Article Title: Can LLMs Replace Data Analysts? Learning to Collaborate\n",
      "\n",
      "Article Content (excerpt):\n",
      "**Collaboration** is a core aspect of analysts’ day-to-day jobs. Frequently, we encounter high-level requests such as, \"What will be the impact of the new feature?\" or \"What is going on with retention?\". Before jumping to writing queries and pulling data, we usually need to define tasks more clearly: talk to stakeholders, understand their needs thoroughly, and determine how we can provide the best assistance.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, for an LLM-powered analyst, mastering the art of posing and addressing follow-up questions is essential since I can’t imagine an analyst working in isolation.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this article, we will teach our LLM analyst to ask clarifying questions and follow long conversations. We will talk in detail about different memory implementations in LangChain.\n",
      "\n",
      "We’ve already discussed many aspects of LLM agents in the previous articles. So, let me quickly summarise them. Also, since our last implementation, LangChain has been updated, and it’s time to catch up.\n",
      "\n",
      "## LLM agents recap\n",
      "\n",
      "Let’s quickly recap what we’ve already learned about LLM agents.\n",
      "\n",
      "* We’ve [discussed](https://towardsdatascience.com/can-llms-replace-data-analysts-building-an-llm-powered-analyst-851578fa10ce) how to empower LLMs with external tools. It helps them overcome limitations (i.e., poor performance on maths tasks) and get access to the world (i.e., your database or internet).\n",
      "* The core idea of the LLM agents is to use LLM as a reasoning engine to define the set of actions to take and leverage tools. So, in this approach, you don’t need to hardcode the logic and just let LLM make decisions on the following steps to achieve the final goal.\n",
      "* We’ve [implemented](https://towardsdatascience.com/can-llms-replace-data-analysts-getting-answers-using-sql-8cf7da132259) an LLM-powered agent that can work with SQL databases and answer user requests.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since our last iteration, LangChain has been [updated](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain/releases) from 0.0.350 to 0.1.0 version. The documentation and best practices for LLM agents have changed. This domain is developing quickly, so it’s no surprise the tools are evolving, too. Let’s quickly recap.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, LangChain has significantly improved [the documentation](https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/agents/agent_types/), and now you can find a clear, structured view of the supported agent types and the differences between them.\n",
      "\n",
      "It’s easier for models to work with tools with just one input parameter, so some agents have such limitations. However, in most real-life cases, tools have several arguments. So, let’s focus on the agents capable of working with multiple inputs. It leaves us just three possible options.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **[OpenAI tools](https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/agents/agent_types/openai_tools)**\n",
      "\n",
      "* It’s the most cutting-edge type of agent since it supports chat history, tools with multiple inputs and even parallel function calling.\n",
      "* You can use it with the recent OpenAI models (after `1106`) since they were fine-tuned for tool calling.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **[OpenAI functions](https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/agents/agent_types/openai_functions_agent)**\n",
      "\n",
      "* OpenAI functions agents are close to OpenAI tools but are slightly different under the hood.\n",
      "* Such agents don’t support parallel function calling.\n",
      "* You can use recent OpenAI models that were fine-tuned to work with functions (the complete list is [here](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/function-calling/supported-models)) or compatible open-source LLMs.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **[Structured chat](https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/agents/agent_types/structured_chat)**\n",
      "\n",
      "* This approach is similar to ReAct. It instructs an agent to follow the Thought -> Action -> Observation framework.\n",
      "* It doesn’t support parallel function calling, just as OpenAI functions approach.\n",
      "* You can use it with any model.\n",
      "\n",
      "> Also, you can notice that the experimental agent types we tried in [the previous article](https://towardsdatascience.com/can-llms-replace-data-analysts-getting-answers-using-sql-8cf7da132259), such as BabyAGI, Plan-and-execute and AutoGPT, are still not part of the suggested options. They might be included later (I hope), but for now I wouldn’t recommend using them in production.\n",
      "\n",
      "After reading the new documentation, I’ve finally realised the difference between OpenAI tools and OpenAI functions agents. With the OpenAI tools approach, an agent can call multiple tools at the same iterations, while other agent types don’t support such functionality. Let’s see how it works and why it matters.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let’s create two agents – OpenAI tools and OpenAI functions. We will empower them with two tools:\n",
      "\n",
      "* `get_monthly_active_users` returns the number of active customers for city and month. To simplify debugging, we will be using a dummy function for it. In practice, we would go to our database to retrieve this data.\n",
      "* `percentage_difference` calculates the difference between two metrics.\n",

      "## 1. **LLM Agents with Tool-Calling Capabilities**\n",
      "- Evolution from simple LLMs to agents that use external tools (databases, calculators, APIs)\n",
      "- LLMs serving as \"reasoning engines\" to decide which actions/tools to use dynamically\n",
      "- Focus on overcoming LLM limitations through tool integration rather than hardcoding logic\n",
      "\n",
      "## 2. **Advanced Function/Tool Calling Patterns**\n",
      "- **Parallel function calling** - ability to execute multiple tool calls simultaneously in one iteration (OpenAI Tools agents)\n",
      "- Comparison of three agent architectures: OpenAI Tools, OpenAI Functions, and Structured Chat (ReAct-style)\n",
      "- Multi-input tool support as a production requirement (vs. single-input limitations)\n",
      "\n",
      "## 3. **Conversational Memory and Human-in-the-Loop AI**\n",
      "- Teaching agents to ask clarifying questions before executing tasks\n",
      "- Implementation of \"Human\" tools for collaborative workflows between AI and analysts\n",
      "- Focus on conversation context and memory management in LangChain framework\n",
      "- Emphasis on agents that collaborate rather than work in isolation\n",
      "\n",
      "## 4. **LangChain Framework Evolution and Best Practices**\n",
      "- Rapid framework updates (0.0.350 → 0.1.0) reflecting fast-moving domain\n",
      "- Move away from experimental agent types (BabyAGI, Plan-and-execute, AutoGPT) toward production-ready patterns\n",
      "- Improved documentation and structured agent type taxonomies\n",
      "- Production considerations: token efficiency, cost optimization (21.9% token reduction with parallel calling)\n",
      "\n",
      "## 5. **Prompt Engineering for Agent Behavior**\n",
      "- Strategic system message design to encourage specific agent behaviors (asking follow-up questions, accuracy requirements)\n",
      "- Tool description optimization to guide agent decision-making\n",

Use small, targeted prints to sanity-check, but avoid manual copying when variables can carry the exact value.\n",

Tools like GitHub Copilot, Claude Desktop, OpenAI Operator, and Perplexity Comet are automating everyday tasks that would’ve seemed impossible to automate just five years ago.

That’s why I’ve decided to share a series of posts on agentic AI design concepts that’ll help you understand how all these magical tools actually work.\n",

      "--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "# Key AI Trends and Concepts from the Article\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on this 2025 article, here are the main AI trends and concepts discussed:\n",
      "\n",
      "## 1. **Agentic AI and Reflection Design Pattern**\n",
      "The core focus is on **reflection** as a fundamental agentic design pattern where LLMs iteratively review and improve their outputs through feedback loops, mimicking human work processes. This enables AI agents to self-critique and refine results rather than generating responses in a single pass.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 2. **Building AI Systems from First Principles**\n",
      "A trend toward understanding AI tools \"from scratch\" rather than relying solely on high-level frameworks. The article advocates working directly with foundation model APIs to gain deeper understanding of how agentic systems actually work.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 3. **Self-Correction and Iterative Refinement Techniques**\n",
      "Key methodologies cited include:\n",
      "- **Self-Refine** (self-feedback loops)\n",
      "- **Reflexion** (verbal reinforcement learning)\n",
      "- **CRITIC** (tool-interactive critiquing with external feedback)\n",
      "- **ReAct** (combining reasoning and acting)\n",
      "\n",
      "These approaches show 10-30% performance improvements across diverse tasks.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 4. **Popular Agentic AI Frameworks**\n",
      "Mentioned tools and frameworks include: GitHub Copilot, Claude Desktop, OpenAI Operator, Perplexity Comet, CrewAI, smolagents, DSPy, and LangGraph.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 5. **Production Trade-offs: Quality vs. Cost/Latency**\n",
      "Recognition that reflection's quality improvements must be balanced against increased API calls, latency, and costs—a key consideration for real-world business applications.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Beyond Prompting: The Power of Context Engineering\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "# Key AI Trends and Concepts from the Article\n",
      "\n",
      "## 1. **Context Engineering as a Discipline**\n",
      "A systematic approach to optimizing what information goes into an LLM's prompt, positioning itself as a cost-effective alternative to fine-tuning. Focuses on making \"self-improving\" systems that learn from experience without retraining model parameters.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 2. **Evolution from Static to Self-Improving Contexts**\n",
      "Progression through three stages:\n",
      "- **Static prompting** (hand-crafted, fixed instructions)\n",
      "- **Dynamic retrieval** (RAG - Retrieval-Augmented Generation)\n",
      "- **Self-improving contexts** (adaptive systems that update based on past performance)\n",
      "\n",
      "## 3. **Agentic Context Engineering (ACE) Framework**\n",
      "A novel 2025 approach that addresses \"brevity bias\" and \"context collapse\" through:\n",
      "- Structured \"playbook\" of reusable knowledge bullets with metadata\n",
      "- Three-component loop: Generator → Reflector → Curator\n",
      "- Incremental delta updates rather than full prompt rewrites\n",
      "- 83.6% lower token costs with +10.6% performance improvement on benchmarks\n",
      "\n",
      "## 4. **Natural Language-Based Learning Methods**\n",
      "Emergence of frameworks using verbal/textual feedback instead of gradient-based updates:\n",
      "- **Reflexion** - learning through natural language reflection\n",
      "- **TextGrad** - \"backpropagation\" using textual critiques\n",
      "- **GEPA** - evolutionary algorithms with prompt mutation and selection\n",
      "\n",
      "## 5. **Test-Time Learning and Adaptive Memory**\n",
      "Systems that accumulate and reuse knowledge during inference without explicit retraining, enabling continuous improvement through persistent memory mechanisms.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Based on this article, here are the main AI trends and concepts discussed:\n",
      "\n",
      "## 1. **LLM Agents and Agentic AI**\n",
      "The article introduces **LLM agents** as a paradigm shift from predefined workflows to autonomous reasoning systems. Instead of hardcoding every step, agents use LLMs as a \"reasoning engine\" to dynamically choose actions and determine when to return final answers—mirroring how human analysts work.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 2. **Tool-Using LLMs (Function Calling)**\n",
      "The article focuses on **OpenAI function calling** as a critical capability that allows LLMs to interact with external systems. This enables LLMs to invoke tools like SQL executors, calculators, or search engines, bridging the gap between language models and real-world data systems.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 3. **Structured Output via Function Calling**\n",
      "Two key use cases for functions are highlighted:\n",
      "- **Tagging & Extraction**: Using function calls to ensure structured, validated output formats instead of unstructured text\n",
      "- **Tools & Routing**: Enabling agent-like behavior where LLMs can select and execute appropriate tools\n",
      "\n",
      "## 4. **Pydantic for Schema Definition**\n",

      "In my previous articles, we discussed how to do Topic Modelling using ChatGPT. Our task was to analyse customer comments for different hotel chains and identify the main topics mentioned for each hotel.\n",
      "\n",
      "As a result of such Topic Modelling, we know topics for each customer review and can easily filter by them and dive deeper. However, in real life, it’s impossible to have such an exhaustive set of topics that could cover all your possible use cases.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, here’s the list of topics we identified from customer feedback earlier.\n",
      "\n",
      "![](https://towardsdatascience.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1u-0ZwPtPeXH2mCqNrdSgkA.jpeg)\n",
      "\n",
      "These topics can help us get a high-level overview of the customer feedback and do initial pre-filtering. But suppose we want to understand what customers think about the gym or beverages for breakfast. In that case, we will need to go through quite a lot of customer feedback ourselves from \"Hotel facilities\" and \"Breakfast\" topics.\n",
      "\n",
      "Luckily, LLMs could help us with this analysis and save many hours of going through customers’ reviews (even though it still might be helpful to listen to the customer’s voice yourself). In this article we will discuss such approaches.\n",
      "\n",
      "We will continue using LangChain (one of the most popular frameworks for LLM applications). You can find a basic overview of LangChain in [my previous article](https://medium.com/towards-data-science/topic-modelling-in-production-e3b3e99e4fca).\n",
      "\n",
      "## Naive approaches\n",
      "\n",
      "The most straightforward way to get comments related to a specific topic is just to look for some particular words in the texts, like \"gym\" or \"drink\". I’ve been using this approach many times when ChatGPT didn’t exist.\n",
      "\n",
      "The problems with this approach are pretty obvious:\n",
      "\n",
      "* You might get quite a lot of not relevant comments about gymnasia nearby or alcoholic drinks in the hotel restaurant. Such filters are not specific enough and can’t take context into account so that you will have a lot of false positives.\n",
      "* On the other hand, you might not have good enough coverage as well. People tend to use slightly different words for the same things (for example, drinks, refreshments, beverages, juices, etc). There might be typos. And this task might become even more convoluted if your customers speak different languages.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, this approach has problems both with precision and recall. It will give you a rough understanding of the question, but its capabilities are limited.\n",
      "\n",
      "The other potential solution is to use the same approach as with Topic Modelling: send all customer comments to LLM and ask the model to define whether they are related to our topic of interest (beverages at breakfast or gym). We can even ask the model to sum up all customer feedback and provide a conclusion.\n",
      "\n",
      "This approach is likely to work pretty well. However, it has its limitations too: you will need to send all the documents you have to LLM each time you want to dive deeper into a particular topic. Even with high-level filtering based on topics we defined, it might be quite a lot of data to pass to LLM, and it will be rather costly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Luckily, there is another way to solve this task, and it’s called RAG.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Retrieval-augmented generation\n",
      "\n",
      "We have a set of documents (customer reviews), and we want to ask questions related to the content of these documents (for example, \"What do customers like about breakfast?\"). As we discussed before, we don’t want to send all customer reviews to LLM, so we need to have a way to define only the most relevant ones. Then, the task will be pretty straightforward: pass the user question and these documents as the context to LLM, and that’s it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Such an approach is called [Retrieval-augmented generation](https://python.langchain.com/docs/use_cases/question_answering/) or RAG.\n",
      "\n",
      "![Scheme by author](https://towardsdatascience.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1Kq_qp1cv1HflQpHvr95wEg.png)\n",
      "\n",
      "Scheme by author\n",
      "\n",
      "The pipeline for RAG consists of the following stages:\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Loading documents** from the data sources we have.\n",
      "* **Splitting documents** into chunks that are easy to use further.\n",
      "* **Storage:** vector stores are often used for this use case to process data effectively.\n",
      "* **Retrieval** of relevant to the question documents.\n",
      "* **Generation** is passing a question and relevant documents to LLM and getting the final answer**.**\n",
      "\n",
      "You might have heard that OpenAI launched [Assistant API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/assistants/tools/function-calling) this week, which could do all these steps for you. However, I believe it’s worth going through the whole process to understand how it works and its peculiarities.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, let’s go through all these stages step-by-step.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Loading documents\n",
      "\n",
      "The first step is to load our documents. LangChain supports different document types, for example, [CSV](https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/data_connection/document_loaders/csv) or [JSON](https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/data_connection/document_loaders/json).\n",
      "\n",
      "You might wonder what is the benefit of using LangChain for such basic data types. It goes without saying that you can parse CSV or JSON files using standard Python libraries. However, I recommend using LangChain data loaders API since it returns Document objects containing content and metadata. It will be easier for you to use LangChain Documents later on.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let’s look at a bit more complex examples of data types.\n",
      "\n",
      "We often have tasks to analyse web page content, so we have to work with HTML. Even if you’ve already mastered the [BeautifulSoup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/) library, you might find [BSHTMLLoader](https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/data_connection/document_loaders/html) helpful.\n",
      "\n",
      "What’s interesting about HTML related to LLM applications is that, most likely, you will need to preprocess it a lot. If you look at any website using Browser Inspector, you will notice much more text than you see on the site. It’s used to specify the layout, formatting, styles, etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "![Image by author, LangChain documentation](https://towardsdatascience.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1WJAFAI7LklXJUpOR6hVHQQ-scaled.jpeg)\n",
      "\n",
      "Image by author, [LangChain documentation](https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/data_connection/document_loaders/html)\n",
      "\n",
      "In most real-life cases, we won’t need to pass all this data to LLM. The whole HTML for a site could easily exceed 200K tokens (and only ~10–20% of it will be text you see as a user), so it would be challenging to fit it into a context size. More than that, this technical info might make the model’s job a bit harder.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, it’s pretty standard to extract only text from HTML and use it for further analysis. To do it, you could use the command below. As a result, you will get a Document object where text from the web page is in the `page_content` parameter.\n",
      "\n",
      "```wp-block-prismatic-blocks\n",
      "from langchain.document_loaders import BSHTMLLoader\n",
      "\n",
      "loader = BSHTMLLoader(\"my_site.html\")\n",
      "data = loader.load()\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "The other commonly used data type is PDF. We can parse PDFs, for example, using the PyPDF library. Let’s load text from DALL-E 3 paper.\n",
      "\n",
      "```wp-block-prismatic-blocks\n",
      "from langchain.document_loaders import PyPDFLoader\n",
      "loader = PyPDFLoader(\"https://cdn.openai.com/papers/DALL_E_3_System_Card.pdf\")\n",
      "doc = loader.load()\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "In the output, you will get a set of Documents – one for each page. In metadata, both `source` and `page` fields will be populated.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, as you can see, LangChain allows you to work with an extensive range of different document types.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let’s return to our initial task. In our dataset, we have a separate .txt file with customer comments for each hotel. We need to parse all files in the directory and put them together. We can use `DirectoryLoader` for it.\n",
      "\n",
      "```wp-block-prismatic-blocks\n",
      "from langchain.document_loaders import TextLoader, DirectoryLoader\n",
      "\n",
      "text_loader_kwargs={'autodetect_encoding': True}\n",
      "loader = DirectoryLoader('./hotels/london', show_progress=True, \n",
      "    loader_cls=TextLoader, loader_kwargs=text_loader_kwargs)\n",
      "\n",
      "docs = loader.load()\n",
      "len(docs)\n",
      "82\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "I’ve also used `'autodetect_encoding': True` since our texts are encoded not in standard UTF-8.\n",
      "\n",
      "As a result, we got the list of documents – one document for each text file. We know that each document consists of individual customer reviews. It will be more effective for us to work with smaller chunks rather than with all customer comments for a hotel. So, we need to split our documents. Let’s move on to the next stage and discuss document splitting in detail.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Splitting documents\n",
      "\n",
      "The next step is to split documents. You might wonder why we need to do this. Documents are often long and cover multiple topics, for example, Confluence pages or documentation. If we pass such lengthy texts to LLMs, we might face issues that either LLM is distracted by irrelevant information or texts don’t fit the context size.\n",
      "\n",

      "Article Title: Programming, Not Prompting: A Hands-On Guide to DSPy\n",
      "\n",
      "Article Content (excerpt):\n",
      "The modern GenAI landscape is built around prompting. We instruct LLMs like ChatGPT or Claude using long, highly detailed, step-by-step guides to achieve the desired outcomes. Crafting these prompts takes a lot of time and effort, but we’re willing to spend it since better prompts usually lead to better results.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, reaching an optimal prompt is often a challenging task. It’s a trial-and-error process, where it’s not always clear what will work best for your specific task or a given LLM. As a result, it can take many iterations to arrive at a satisfactory result, especially when your prompt is several thousand words long.\n",
      "\n",
      "To address these challenges, DataBricks launched the DSPy framework. DSPy stands for *Declarative Self-improving Python*. This framework allows you to build modular AI applications. It is based on the idea that LLM tasks can be treated as programming rather than manual prompting. Using standard building blocks, you can create a wide range of AI applications: from simple classifiers to RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) systems or even agents.\n",
      "\n",
      "This approach seems promising. It would be exciting to build AI applications the same way as we build traditional software. So, I decided to give DSPy a try.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this article, we’ll explore the DSPy framework and its capabilities for building LLM pipelines. We’ll start with a simple combinatorics task to cover the basics. Then, we’ll apply DSPy to a real business problem: classifying NPS detractor comments. Based on this example, we’ll also test one of the framework’s most promising features: automatic instruction optimisation.\n",
      "\n",
      "## DSPy basics\n",
      "\n",
      "We’ll begin exploring the DSPy framework by installing the package.\n",
      "\n",
      "```wp-block-prismatic-blocks\n",
      "pip install -U dspy\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "As mentioned above, DSPy defines LLM applications in a structured and modular way. Every application is built using three main components:\n",
      "\n",
      "* **language model** — LLM that will answer our questions,\n",
      "* **signature** —a declaration of the program’s input and output (*what task we want to solve*),\n",
      "* **module**— the prompting technique (*how we want to solve the task*).\n",
      "\n",
      "Let’s try it out with a very simple example.\n",
      "\n",
      "As usual, we will start with a language model — the core of any LLM-powered application. I will be using a local model ([Llama](https://www.llama.com/) by Meta), accessed via [Ollama](https://github.com/ollama/ollama). If you don’t have Ollama installed yet, you can follow the instructions in [the documentation](https://github.com/ollama/ollama).\n",
      "\n",
      "To create a language model in a DSPy application, we need to initialise a `dspy.LM` object and set it as a default LLM for our app. It goes without saying that DSPy supports not only local models but also popular APIs, such as OpenAI and Anthropic.\n",
      "\n",
      "```wp-block-prismatic-blocks\n",
      "import dspy\n",
      "llm = dspy.LM('ollama_chat/llama3.2', \n",
      "  api_base='http://localhost:11434', \n",
      "  api_key='', temperature = 0.3)\n",
      "dspy.configure(lm=llm)\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "We have our language model set up. The next step is to define the task by creating a module and a signature.\n",
      "\n",
      "A **signature** defines the input and output for the model. It tells the model what we’re giving it and what result we expect in the end. The signature doesn’t specify to the model how to solve the task, it’s only a declaration.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are two ways to define a signature in DSPy: inline or using a class. For our first quick example, we will use a simple inline approach, but we will cover class-based definitions later in the article.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Modules** are the building blocks of DSPy applications. They abstract different prompting strategies, such as [Chain-of-Thought](https://www.promptingguide.ai/techniques/cot) or [ReAct](https://www.promptingguide.ai/techniques/react.en). Modules are designed to work with any signature, so you don’t need to worry about compatibility yourself.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here are some of the most commonly used DSPy modules (you can find the full list in [the documentation](https://dspy.ai/learn/programming/modules/)):\n",
      "\n",
      "* `dspy.Predict` — a basic predictor;\n",
      "* `dspy.ChainOfThought` — guides an LLM to think step-by-step before returning a final answer;\n",
      "* `dspy.ReAct` — a basic agent that can call tools.\n",
      "\n",
      "We will start with the simplest version— `dspy.Predict` and will build a basic model that can answer combinatorics questions. Since we expect an answer to be an integer, I’ve specified that in a signature.\n",

      "The answer is definitely wrong. LLM shared the correct formula, but gave 55 instead of the correct result (2,042,975). This is expected. The model hallucinated because it couldn’t perform the calculation accurately. So, it’s a perfect use case for an agent. We will equip our agent with a tool to do calculations and, hopefully, it will solve the problem.\n",

However, it initially forgot to import the math module, causing the execution to fail. On the next iteration, it corrected the Python code and got the result. For some reason, though, it repeated precisely the same action three more times. Not ideal, but we still got our answer.\n",

      "\n",
      "Article Content (excerpt):\n",
      "Initially, when ChatGPT just appeared, we used simple prompts to get answers to our questions. Then, we encountered issues with hallucinations and began using RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) to provide more context to LLMs. After that, we started experimenting with AI agents, where LLMs act as a reasoning engine and can decide what to do next, which tools to use, and when to return the final answer.\n",
      "\n",
      "The next evolutionary step is to create teams of such agents that can collaborate with each other. This approach is logical as it mirrors human interactions. We work in teams where each member has a specific role:\n",
      "\n",
      "* The product manager proposes the next project to work on.\n",
      "* The designer creates its look and feel.\n",
      "* The software engineer develops the solution.\n",
      "* The analyst examines the data to ensure it performs as expected and identifies ways to improve the product for customers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Similarly, we can create a team of AI agents, each focusing on one domain. They can collaborate and reach a final conclusion together. Just as specialization enhances performance in real life, it could also benefit the performance of AI agents.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another advantage of this approach is increased flexibility. Each agent can operate with its own prompt, set of tools and even LLM. For instance, we can use different models for different parts of our system. You can use GPT-4 for the agent that needs more reasoning and GPT-3.5 for the one that does only simple extraction. We can even fine-tune the model for small specific tasks and use it in our crew of agents.\n",
      "\n",
      "The potential drawbacks of this approach are time and cost. Multiple interactions and knowledge sharing between agents require more calls to LLM and consume additional tokens. This could result in longer wait times and increased expenses.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are several frameworks available for multi-agent systems today.\n",
      "Here are some of the most popular ones:\n",
      "\n",
      "* [AutoGen](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen?ref=blog.langchain.dev): Developed by Microsoft, AutoGen uses a conversational approach and was one of the earliest frameworks for multi-agent systems,\n",
      "* [LangGraph](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph): While not strictly a multi-agent framework, LangGraph allows for defining complex interactions between actors using a graph structure. So, it can also be adapted to create multi-agent systems.\n",
      "* [CrewAI](https://github.com/joaomdmoura/crewAI?ref=blog.langchain.dev): Positioned as a high-level framework, CrewAI facilitates the creation of \"crews\" consisting of role-playing agents capable of collaborating in various ways.\n",
      "\n",
      "I’ve decided to start experimenting with multi-agent frameworks from CrewAI since it’s quite widely popular and user friendly. So, it looks like a good option to begin with.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this article, I will walk you through how to use CrewAI. As analysts, we’re the domain experts responsible for documenting various data sources and addressing related questions. We’ll explore how to automate these tasks using multi-agent frameworks.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Setting up the environment\n",
      "\n",
      "Let’s start with setting up the environment. First, we need to install the CrewAI main package and an extension to work with tools.\n",

      "CrewAI was developed to work primarily with OpenAI API, but I would also like to try it with a local model. According to [the ChatBot Arena Leaderboard](https://chat.lmsys.org/?leaderboard), the best model you can run on your laptop is Llama 3 (8b parameters). It will be the most feasible option for our use case.\n",
      "\n",
      "We can access Llama models using Ollama. Installation is pretty straightforward. You need to download Ollama from [the website](https://ollama.com/download) and then go through the installation process. That’s it.\n",

      "\n",
      "As analysts, we often play the role of subject matter experts for data and some data-related tools. In my previous team, we used to have a channel with almost 1K participants, where we were answering lots of questions about our data and the ClickHouse database we used as storage. It took us quite a lot of time to manage this channel. It would be interesting to see whether such tasks can be automated with LLMs.\n",
      "\n",

However, we won’t utilise any ClickHouse-specific features, so feel free to stick to the database you know.\n",
      "\n",
      "I’ve created a pretty simple data model to work with. There are just two tables in our DWH (Data Warehouse): `ecommerce_db.users` and `ecommerce_db.sessions`. As you might guess, the first table contains information about the users of our service.\n",

      "\n",
      "Regarding data source management, analysts typically handle tasks like writing and updating documentation and answering questions about this data. So, we will use LLM to write documentation for the table in the database and teach it to answer questions about data or ClickHouse.\n",
      "\n",
      "But before moving on to the implementation, let’s learn more about the CrewAI framework and its core concepts.\n",
      "\n",
      "## CrewAI basic concepts\n",
      "\n",
      "The cornerstone of a multi-[agent](https://docs.crewai.com/core-concepts/Agents/) framework is an **agent** concept. In CrewAI, agents are powered by role-playing. Role-playing is a tactic when you ask an agent to adopt a persona and behave like a top-notch backend engineer or helpful customer support agent. So, when creating a CrewAI agent, you need to specify each agent’s role, goal, and backstory so that LLM knows enough to play this role.\n",
      "\n",
      "The agents’ capabilities are limited without **[tools](https://docs.crewai.com/core-concepts/Tools/)** (functions that agents can execute and get results). With CrewAI, you can use one of the predefined tools (for example, to search the Internet, parse a website, or do RAG on a document), create a custom tool yourself or use LangChain tools. So, it’s pretty easy to create a powerful agent.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let’s move on from agents to the work they are doing. Agents are working on **[tasks](https://docs.crewai.com/core-concepts/Tasks/#task-attributes)** (specific assignments). For each task, we need to define a description, expected output (definition of done), set of available tools and assigned agent. I really like that these frameworks follow the managerial best practices like a clear definition of done for the tasks.\n",
      "\n",
      "The next question is how to define the execution order for tasks: which one to work on first, which ones can run in parallel, etc. CrewAI implemented **[processes](https://docs.crewai.com/core-concepts/Processes/)** to orchestrate the tasks. It provides a couple of options:\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Sequential** -the most straightforward approach when tasks are called one after another.\n",
      "* **Hierarchical** – when there’s a manager (specified as LLM model) that creates and delegates tasks to the agents.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, CrewAI is working on a consensual process. In such a process, agents will be able to make decisions collaboratively with a democratic approach.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are other levers you can use to tweak the process of tasks’ execution:\n",
      "\n",
      "* You can mark tasks as \"asynchronous\", then they will be executed in parallel, so you will be able to get an answer faster.\n",
      "* You can use the \"human input\" flag on a task, and then the agent will ask for human approval before finalising the output of this task. It can allow you to add an oversight to the process.\n",
      "\n",
      "We’ve defined all the primary building blocks and can discuss the holly grail of CrewAI – **[crew](https://docs.crewai.com/core-concepts/Crews/#crew-attributes)** concept. The crew represents the team of agents and the set of tasks they will be working on. The approach for collaboration (processes we discussed above) can also be defined at the crew level.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, we can set up the **[memory](https://docs.crewai.com/core-concepts/Memory/)** for a crew. Memory is crucial for efficient collaboration between the agents. CrewAI supports three levels of memory:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Short-term memory stores information related to the current execution. It helps agents to work together on the current task.\n",
      "* Long-term memory is data about the previous executions stored in the local database. This type of memory allows agents to learn from earlier iterations and improve over time.\n",
      "* Entity memory captures and structures information about entities (like personas, cities, etc.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Right now, you can only switch on all types of memory for a crew without any further customisation. However, it doesn’t work with the Llama models.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Accuracy is often critical for LLM applications, especially in cases such as API calling or summarisation of financial reports. Fortunately, there are ways to enhance precision. The best practices to improve accuracy include the following steps:\n",
      "\n",
      "* You can start simply with **prompt engineering techniques** – adding more detailed instructions, using few-shot prompting, or asking the model to think step-by-step.\n",
      "* If accuracy is still insufficient, you can incorporate a **self-reflection step**, for example, to return errors from the API calls and ask the LLM to correct mistakes.\n",
      "* The next option is to provide the most relevant context to the LLM using **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** to boost precision further.\n",
      "\n",
      "We’ve explored this approach in my previous TDS article, *[\"From Prototype to Production: Enhancing LLM Accuracy\"](https://medium.com/towards-data-science/from-prototype-to-production-enhancing-llm-accuracy-791d79b0af9b).* In that project, we built an SQL Agent and went from 0% valid SQL queries to 70% accuracy. However, there are limits to what we can achieve with prompt. To break through this barrier and reach the next frontier of accuracy, we need to adopt more advanced techniques.\n",
      "\n",
      "The most promising option is fine-tuning. With fine-tuning, we can move from relying solely on information in prompts to embedding additional information directly into the model’s weights.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Fine-tuning\n",
      "\n",
      "Let’s start by understanding what fine-tuning is. Fine-tuning is the process of refining pre-trained models by training them on smaller, task-specific datasets to enhance their performance in particular applications. Basic models are initially trained on vast amounts of data, which allows them to develop a broad understanding of language. Fine-tuning, however, tailors these models to specialized tasks, transforming them from general-purpose systems into highly targeted tools. For example, instruction fine-tuning taught GPT-2 to chat and follow instructions, and that’s how ChatGPT emerged.\n",
      "\n",
      "Basic LLMs are initially trained to predict the next token based on vast text corpora. Fine-tuning typically adopts a supervised approach, where the model is presented with specific questions and corresponding answers, allowing it to adjust its weights to improve accuracy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Historically, fine-tuning required updating all model weights, a method known as full fine-tuning. This process was computationally expensive since it required storing all the model weights, states, gradients and forward activations in memory. To address these challenges, parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques were introduced. PEFT methods update only the small set of the model parameters while keeping the rest frozen. Among these methods, one of the most widely adopted is [LoRA](https://github.com/microsoft/LoRA) (Low-Rank Adaptation), which significantly reduces the computational cost without compromising performance.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Pros & cons\n",
      "\n",
      "Before considering fine-tuning, it’s essential to weigh its advantages and limitations.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Advantages:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* Fine-tuning enables the model to learn and retain significantly more information than can be provided through prompts alone.\n",
      "* It usually gives higher accuracy, often exceeding 90%.\n",
      "* During inference, it can reduce costs by enabling the use of smaller, task-specific models instead of larger, general-purpose ones.\n",
      "* Fine-tuned small models can often be deployed on-premises, eliminating reliance on cloud providers such as OpenAI or Anthropic. This approach reduces costs, enhances privacy, and minimizes dependency on external infrastructure.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Disadvantages:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* Fine-tuning requires upfront investments for model training and data preparation.\n",
      "* It requires specific technical knowledge and may involve a steep learning curve.\n",
      "* The quality of results depends heavily on the availability of high-quality training data.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since this project is focused on gaining knowledge, we will proceed with fine-tuning. However, in real-world scenarios, it’s important to evaluate whether the benefits of fine-tuning justify all the associated costs and efforts.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Execution\n",
      "\n",
      "The next step is to plan how we will approach fine-tuning. After listening to the [\"Improving Accuracy of LLM Applications\"](https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/improving-accuracy-of-llm-applications/) course, I’ve decided to try [the Lamini platform](https://www.lamini.ai/) for the following reasons:\n",
      "\n",
      "* It offers a simple one-line API call to fine-tune the model. It’s especially convenient since we’re just starting to learn a new technique.\n",
      "* Although it’s not free and can be quite expensive for toy projects (at $1 per tuning step), they offer free credits upon registration, which are sufficient for initial testing.\n",
      "* Lamini has implemented a new approach, Lamini Memory Tuning, which promises zero loss of factual accuracy while preserving general capabilities. This is a significant claim, and it’s worth testing out. We will discuss this approach in more detail shortly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course, there are lots of other fine-tuning options you can consider:\n",
      "\n",
      "* [The Llama documentation](https://www.llama.com/docs/how-to-guides/fine-tuning/) provides numerous recipes for fine-tuning, which can be executed on a cloud server or even locally for smaller models.\n",
      "* There are many step-by-step guides available online, including the tutorial on how to fine-tune Llama on Kaggle from [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/fine-tuning-llama-3-1).\n",
      "* You can fine-tune not only open-sourced models. OpenAI also [offers](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/fine-tuning#which-models-can-be-fine-tuned) the capability to fine-tune their models.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Lamini Memory Tuning\n",
      "\n",
      "As I mentioned earlier, Lamini released a new approach to fine-tuning, and I believe it’s worth discussing it in more detail.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lamini introduced the Mixture of Memory Experts (MoME) approach, which enables LLMs to learn a vast amount of factual information with almost zero loss, all while maintaining generalization capabilities and requiring a feasible amount of computational resources.\n",
      "\n",
      "To achieve this, Lamini extended a pre-trained LLM by adding a large number (on the order of 1 million) of LoRA adapters along with a cross-attention layer. Each LoRA adapter is a memory expert, functioning as a type of memory for the model. These memory experts specialize in different aspects, ensuring that the model retains faithful and accurate information from the data it was tuned on. Inspired by information retrieval, these million memory experts are equivalent to indices from which the model intelligently retrieves and routes.\n",
      "\n",
      "At inference time, the model retrieves a subset of the most relevant experts at each layer and merges back into the base model to generate a response to the user query.\n",
      "\n",
      "![Figure from the paper by Li et al. 2024 | source](https://towardsdatascience.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/134DX-ZD4n-w_kJY0rpc47A.png)\n",
      "\n",
      "Figure from the paper by Li et al. 2024 | [source](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17642)\n",
      "\n",
      "Lamini Memory Tuning is [said](https://www.lamini.ai/blog/lamini-memory-tuning) to be capable of achieving 95% accuracy. The key difference from traditional instruction fine-tuning is that instead of optimizing for average error across all tasks, this approach focuses on achieving zero error for the facts the model is specifically trained to remember.\n",
      "\n",
      "![Figure from the paper by Li et al. 2024 | source](https://towardsdatascience.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/1XcTs2BwiKVu0CDnY093_oA.png)\n",

      "Figure from the paper by Li et al. 2024 | [source](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17642)\n",
      "\n",
      "So, this approach allows an LLM to preserve its ability to generalize with average error on everything else while recalling the important facts nearly perfectly.\n",
      "\n",
      "> For further details, you can refer to the research paper [\"Banishing LLM Hallucinations Requires Rethinking Generalization\"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17642) by Li et al. (2024)\n",
      "\n",
      "Lamini Memory Tuning holds great promise – let’s see if it delivers on its potential in practice.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Setup\n",
      "\n",
      "As always, let’s begin by setting everything up. As we discussed, we’ll be using [Lamini](https://docs.lamini.ai/) to fine-tune Llama, so the first step is to install the Lamini package.\n",
      "\n",
      "```wp-block-prismatic-blocks\n",
      "pip install lamini\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, we need to set up the Lamini API Key on [their website](https://app.lamini.ai/account) and specify it as an environment variable.\n",
      "\n",
      "```wp-block-prismatic-blocks\n",
      "export LAMINI_API_KEY=\"<YOUR-LAMINI-API-KEY>\"\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "As I mentioned above, we will be improving the SQL Agent, so we need a database. For this example, we’ll continue using ClickHouse, but feel free to choose any database that suits your needs. You can find more details on the ClickHouse setup and the database schema in [the previous article](https://medium.com/towards-data-science/from-prototype-to-production-enhancing-llm-accuracy-791d79b0af9b).\n",
      "\n",
      "## Creating a training dataset\n",
      "\n",
      "To fine-tune an LLM, we first need a dataset – in our case, a set of pairs of questions and answers (SQL queries). The task of putting together a dataset might seem daunting, but luckily, we can leverage LLMs to do it.\n",
      "\n",
      "The key factors to consider while preparing the dataset:\n",
      "\n",
      "* **The quality of the data** is crucial, as we will ask the model to remember these facts.\n",
      "* **Diversity** in the examples is important so that a model can learn how to handle different cases.\n",
      "* It’s preferable to use **real data** rather than synthetically generated data since it better represents real-life questions.\n",
      "* The usual minimum size for a fine-tuning dataset is around **1,000 examples**, but the more high-quality data, the better.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Generating examples\n",
      "\n",
      "All the information required to create question-and-answer pairs is present in the database schema, so it will be a feasible task for an LLM to generate examples. Additionally, I have a [representative set](https://github.com/miptgirl/miptgirl_medium/blob/main/sql_agent_accuracy/rag_set.json) of Q&A pairs that I used for RAG approach, which we can present to the LLM as examples of valid queries (using the few-shot prompting technique). Let’s load the RAG dataset.\n",
      "\n",
      "```wp-block-prismatic-blocks\n",
      "# loading a set of examples\n",

      "Article Title: LLM Evaluations: from Prototype to Production\n",
      "\n",
      "Article Content (excerpt):\n",
      "Evaluation is the cornerstone of any machine learning product. Investing in quality measurement delivers significant returns. Let’s explore the potential business benefits.\n",
      "\n",
      "* As management consultant and writer Peter Drucker once said, *“If you can’t measure it, you can’t improve it.”* Building a robust evaluation system helps you identify areas for improvement and take meaningful actions to enhance your product.\n",
      "* LLM evaluations are like testing in software engineering — they allow you to iterate faster and more safely by ensuring a baseline level of quality.\n",
      "* A solid quality framework is especially crucial in highly regulated industries. If you’re implementing AI or LLMs in areas like fintech or healthcare, you’ll likely need to demonstrate that your system works reliably and is continuously monitored over time.\n",
      "* By consistently investing in LLM evaluations and developing a comprehensive set of questions and answers, you may eventually be able to replace a large, expensive LLM with a smaller model fine-tuned to your specific use case. That could lead to significant cost savings.\n",
      "\n",
      "As we’ve seen, a solid quality framework can bring significant value to a business. In this article, I will walk you through the end-to-end process of building an evaluation system for LLM products — from assessing early prototypes to implementing continuous quality monitoring in production.\n",
      "\n",
      "This article will focus on high-level approaches and best practices, but we’ll also touch on specific implementation details. For the hands-on part, I will be using [Evidently](https://www.evidentlyai.com/), an open-source library that offers a comprehensive testing stack for AI products, ranging from classic machine learning to LLMs.\n",
      "\n",
      "I chose to explore the Evidently framework after finishing their well-structured open-source [course on LLM evaluation](https://www.evidentlyai.com/llm-evaluations-course). However, you can implement a similar evaluation system using other tools. There are several great open-source alternatives worth considering. Here are just a few:\n",
      "\n",
      "* [**DeepEval**](https://github.com/confident-ai/deepeval): An open-source LLM evaluation library and online platform offering similar functionality.\n",
      "* [**MLFlow**](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow)**:** A more comprehensive framework that supports the entire ML lifecycle, helping practitioners manage, track, and reproduce every stage of development.\n",
      "* [**LangSmith**](https://www.langchain.com/langsmith)**:** An observability and evaluation platform from the LangChain team.\n",
      "\n",
      "This article will focus on best practices and the overall evaluation process, so feel free to choose whichever framework best suits your needs.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Here’s the plan for the article:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* We will start by introducing the **use case** we will be focusing on: a SQL agent.\n",
      "* Then, we will quickly build a **rough prototype** of the agent — just enough to have something we can evaluate.\n",
      "* Next, we will cover **the evaluation approach during the experimentation phase**: how to collect an evaluation dataset, define useful metrics, and assess the model’s quality.\n",
      "* Finally, we’ll explore **how to monitor the quality of your LLM product post-launch**, highlighting the importance of observability and the additional metrics you can track once the feature is live in production.\n",
      "\n",
      "## The first prototype\n",
      "\n",
      "It’s often easier to discuss a topic when we focus on a specific example, so let’s consider one product. Imagine we’re working on an analytical system that helps our customers track key metrics for their e-commerce businesses — things like the number of customers, revenue, fraud rates, and so on.\n",
      "\n",
      "Through customer research, we learned that a significant portion of our users struggle to interpret our reports. They would much prefer the option to interact with an assistant and get immediate, clear answers to their questions. Therefore, we decided to build an LLM-powered agent that can respond to customer queries about their data.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let’s start by building the first prototype of our LLM product. We’ll keep it simple with an LLM agent equipped with a single tool to execute SQL queries.\n",
      "\n",
      "I’ll be using the following tech stack:\n",
      "\n",
      "* [**Llama 3.1 model**](https://www.llama.com/) via [Ollama](https://ollama.com/search) for the LLM;\n",
      "* [**LangGraph**](https://www.langchain.com/langgraph), one of the most popular frameworks for LLM agents;\n",
      "* [**ClickHouse**](https://clickhouse.com/) as the database, though you’re free to choose your preferred option.\n",

      "\n",
      "Let’s first define the tool to execute SQL queries. I’ve included several controls in the query to ensure that the LLM specifies the output format and avoids using a `select * from table`query, which could result in fetching all the data from the database.\n",

      "```\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "I’ve built an MVP version of the agent, but there’s plenty of room for improvement. For example:\n",
      "\n",
      "* One possible improvement is converting it into a **Multi-AI agent system**, with distinct roles such as a triage agent (which classifies the initial question), an SQL expert, and a final editor (who assembles the customer’s answer according to the guidelines). If you’re interested in building such a system, you can find a detailed guide for LangGraph in [my previous article](https://towardsdatascience.com/from-basics-to-advanced-exploring-langgraph-e8c1cf4db787/).\n",
      "* Another improvement is adding **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**, where we provide relevant examples based on embeddings. In [my previous attempt](https://towardsdatascience.com/from-prototype-to-production-enhancing-llm-accuracy-791d79b0af9b/) at building an SQL agent, RAG helped boost accuracy from 10% to 60%.\n",
      "* Another enhancement is introducing a **human-in-the-loop** approach, where the system can ask customers for feedback.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this article, we will concentrate on developing the evaluation framework, so it’s perfectly fine that our initial version isn’t fully optimised yet.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Prototype: evaluating quality\n",
      "\n",
      "### Gathering evaluation dataset\n",
      "\n",
      "Now that we have our first MVP, we can start focusing on its quality. Any evaluation begins with data, and the first step is to gather a set of questions — and ideally answers — so we have something to measure against.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let’s discuss how we can gather the set of questions:\n",
      "\n",
      "* I recommend starting by **creating a small dataset of questions yourself** and manually testing your product with them. This will give you a better understanding of the actual quality of your solution and help you determine the best way to assess it. Once you have that insight, you can scale the solution effectively.\n",
      "* Another option is to **leverage historical data**. For instance, we may already have a channel where CS agents answer customer questions about our reports. These question-and-answer pairs can be valuable for evaluating our LLM product.\n",
      "* We can also use **synthetic data**. LLMs can generate plausible questions and question-and-answer pairs. For example, in our case, we could expand our initial manual set by asking the LLM to provide similar examples or rephrase existing questions. Alternatively, we could use an RAG approach, where we provide the LLM with parts of our documentation and ask it to generate questions and answers based on that content.\n",
      "\n",
      "> ***Tip**: Using a more powerful model to generate data for evaluation can be beneficial. Creating a golden dataset is a one-time investment that pays off by enabling more reliable and accurate quality assessments.*\n",
      "\n",
      "* Once we have a more mature version, we can potentially share it with a group of beta testers to gather their feedback.\n",
      "\n",
      "When creating your evaluation set, it’s important to include a diverse range of examples. Make sure to cover:\n",
      "\n",
      "* **A representative sample of real user questions** about your product to reflect typical usage.\n",
      "* **Edge cases**, such as very long questions, queries in different languages, or incomplete questions. It’s also crucial to define the expected behaviour in these scenarios — for instance, should the system respond in English if the question is asked in French?\n",
      "* **Adversarial inputs**, like off-topic questions or jailbreak attempts (where users try to manipulate the model into producing inappropriate responses or exposing sensitive information).\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, let’s apply these approaches in practice. Following my own advice, I manually created a small evaluation dataset with 10 questions and corresponding ground truth answers. I then ran our MVP agent on the same questions to collect its responses for comparison.\n",

      "\n",
      "Article Content (excerpt):\n",
      "It’s exciting to see the GenAI industry beginning to move toward standardisation. We might be witnessing something similar to the early days of the internet, when HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) first emerged. When Tim Berners-Lee developed HTTP in 1990, it provided a simple yet extensible protocol that transformed the internet from a specialised research network into the globally accessible World Wide Web. By 1993, web browsers like Mosaic had made HTTP so popular that web traffic quickly outpaced other systems.\n",
      "\n",
      "One promising step in this direction is MCP (Model Context Protocol), developed by Anthropic. MCP is gaining popularity with its attempts to standardise the interactions between LLMs and external tools or data sources. More recently ([*the first commit*](https://github.com/i-am-bee/acp/commit/19e4c708153e23b529d09cdc6e23f0e95ef8a933) *is dated April 2025*), a new protocol called ACP (Agent Communication Protocol) appeared. It complements MCP by defining the ways in which agents can communicate with each other.\n",

      "\n",
      "In this article, I would like to discuss what ACP is, why it can be helpful and how it can be used in practice. We will build a multi-agent AI system for interacting with data.\n",
      "\n",
      "## ACP overview\n",
      "\n",
      "Before jumping into practice, let’s take a moment to understand the theory behind ACP and how it works under the hood.\n",
      "\n",
      "ACP (Agent Communication Protocol) is an open protocol designed to address the growing challenge of connecting AI agents, applications, and humans. The current GenAI industry is quite fragmented, with different teams building agents in isolation using various, often incompatible frameworks and technologies. This fragmentation slows down innovation and makes it difficult for agents to collaborate effectively.\n",
      "\n",
      "To address this challenge, ACP aims to standardise communication between agents via RESTful APIs. The protocol is framework- and technology-agnostic, meaning it can be used with any agentic framework, such as LangChain, CrewAI, smolagents, or others. This flexibility makes it easier to build interoperable systems where agents can seamlessly work together, regardless of how they were originally developed.\n",
      "\n",
      "This protocol has been developed as an open standard under the Linux Foundation, alongside BeeAI (its reference implementation). One of the key points the team emphasises is that ACP is openly governed and shaped by the community, rather than a group of vendors.\n",
      "\n",
      "What benefits can ACP bring?\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Easily replaceable agents.** With the current pace of innovation in the GenAI space, new cutting-edge technologies are emerging all the time. ACP enables agents to be swapped in production seamlessly, reducing maintenance costs and making it easier to adopt the most advanced tools when they become available.\n",
      "* **Enabling collaboration between multiple agents** **built on different frameworks.** As we know from people management, specialisation often leads to better results. The same applies to agentic systems. The group of agents, each focused on a specific task (like writing Python code or researching the web), can often outperform a single agent trying to do everything. ACP makes it possible for such specialised agents to communicate and work together, even if they are built using different frameworks or technologies.\n",
      "* **New opportunities for partnerships.** With a unified standard for agents’ communication, it would be easier for agents to collaborate, sparking new partnerships between different teams within the company or even different companies. Imagine a world where your smart home agent notices the temperature dropping unusually, determines that the heating system has failed, and checks with your utility provider’s agent to confirm there are no planned outages. Finally, it books a technician coordinating the visit with your Google Calendar agent to make sure you’re home. It may sound futuristic, but with ACP, it can be pretty close.\n",
      "\n",
      "We’ve covered what ACP is and why it matters. The protocol looks quite promising. So, let’s put it to the test and see how it works in practice.\n",
      "\n",
      "## ACP in practice\n",
      "\n",
      "Let’s try ACP in a classic “talk to data” use case. To use the benefit of ACP being framework agnostic, we will build ACP agents with different frameworks:\n",
      "\n",
      "* **SQL Agent** with CrewAI to compose SQL queries\n",
      "* **DB Agent** with HuggingFace smolagents to execute those queries.\n",

      "Article Title: From Prototype to Production: Enhancing LLM Accuracy\n",
      "\n",
      "Article Content (excerpt):\n",
      "Building a prototype for an LLM application is surprisingly straightforward. You can often create a functional first version within just a few hours. This initial prototype will likely provide results that look legitimate and be a good tool to demonstrate your approach. However, this is usually not enough for production use.\n",
      "\n",
      "LLMs are probabilistic by nature, as they generate tokens based on the distribution of likely continuations. This means that in many cases, we get the answer close to the \"correct\" one from the distribution. Sometimes, this is acceptable – for example, it doesn’t matter whether the app says \"Hello, John!\" or \"Hi, John!\". In other cases, the difference is critical, such as between \"The revenue in 2024 was 20M USD\" and \"The revenue in 2024 was 20M GBP\".\n",
      "\n",
      "In many real-world business scenarios, precision is crucial, and \"almost right\" isn’t good enough. For example, when your LLM application needs to execute API calls, or you’re doing a summary of financial reports. From my experience, ensuring the accuracy and consistency of results is far more complex and time-consuming than building the initial prototype.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this article, I will discuss how to approach measuring and improving accuracy. We’ll build an SQL Agent where precision is vital for ensuring that queries are executable. Starting with a basic prototype, we’ll explore methods to measure accuracy and test various techniques to enhance it, such as self-reflection and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).\n",
      "\n",
      "## Setup\n",
      "\n",
      "As usual, let’s begin with the setup. The core components of our SQL agent solution are the LLM model, which generates queries, and the SQL database, which executes them.\n",
      "\n",
      "### LLM model – Llama\n",
      "\n",
      "For this project, we will use an open-source Llama model released by Meta. I’ve chosen [Llama 3.1 8B](https://ollama.com/library/llama3.1:8b) because it is lightweight enough to run on my laptop while still being quite powerful (refer to the [documentation](https://ai.meta.com/blog/meta-llama-3-1/) for details).\n",
      "\n",
      "If you haven’t installed it yet, you can find guides [here](https://www.llama.com/docs/llama-everywhere). I use it locally on MacOS via [Ollama](https://ollama.com/). Using the following command, we can download the model.\n",

      "\n",
      "As discussed, our goal is to build an SQL Agent – an application that generates SQL queries to answer customer questions. In the future, we can add another layer to this system: executing the SQL query, passing both the initial question and the database results back to the LLM, and asking it to generate a human-friendly answer. However, for this article, we’ll focus on the first step.\n",
      "\n",
      "The best practice with LLM applications (similar to any other complex tasks) is to start simple and then iterate.

This system will be a cornerstone for performance improvement iterations. Without it, we’d essentially be navigating in the dark.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Evaluating the accuracy\n",
      "\n",
      "### Evaluation basics\n",
      "\n",
      "To ensure we’re improving, we need a robust way to measure accuracy. The most common approach is to create a \"golden\" evaluation set with questions and correct answers. Then, we can compare the model’s output with these \"golden\" answers and calculate the share of correct ones. While this approach sounds simple, there are a few nuances worth discussing.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, you might feel overwhelmed at the thought of creating a comprehensive set of questions and answers. Building such a dataset can seem like a daunting task, potentially requiring weeks or months. However, we can start small by creating an initial set of 20–50 examples and iterating on it.\n",
      "\n",
      "As always, quality is more important than quantity. Our goal is to create a representative and diverse dataset. Ideally, this should include:\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Common questions.** In most real-life cases, we can take the history of actual questions and use it as our initial evaluation set.\n",
      "* **Challenging edge cases.** It’s worth adding examples where the model tends to hallucinate. You can find such cases either while experimenting yourself or by gathering feedback from the first prototype.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once the dataset is ready, the next challenge is how to score the generated results. We can consider several approaches:\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Comparing SQL queries.** The first idea is to compare the generated SQL query with the one in the evaluation set. However, it might be tricky. Similarly-looking queries can yield completely different results. At the same time, queries that look different can lead to the same conclusions. Additionally, simply comparing SQL queries doesn’t verify whether the generated query is actually executable. Given these challenges, I wouldn’t consider this approach the most reliable solution for our case.\n",
      "* **Exact matches.** We can use old-school exact matching when answers in our evaluation set are deterministic. For example, if the question is, \"How many customers are there?\" and the answer is \"592800\", the model’s response must match precisely. However, this approach has its limitations. Consider the example above, and the model responds, *\"There are 592,800 customers\"*. While the answer is absolutely correct, an exact match approach would flag it as invalid.\n",
      "* **Using LLMs for scoring.** A more robust and flexible approach is to leverage LLMs for evaluation. Instead of focusing on query structure, we can ask the LLM to compare the results of SQL executions. This method is particularly effective in cases where the query might differ but still yields correct outputs.\n",
      "\n",
      "It’s worth keeping in mind that evaluation isn’t a one-time task; it’s a continuous process. To push our model’s performance further, we need to expand the dataset with examples causing the model’s hallucinations. In production mode, we can create a feedback loop. By gathering input from users, we can identify cases where the model fails and\n",

      "# Key AI Trends and Concepts from the Article\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on this 2025 article, here are the main AI trends and concepts discussed:\n",
      "\n",
      "## 1. **Agentic AI and Reflection Design Pattern**\n",
      "The core focus is on **reflection** as a fundamental agentic design pattern where LLMs iteratively review and improve their outputs through feedback loops, mimicking human work processes. This enables AI agents to self-critique and refine results rather than generating responses in a single pass.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 2. **Building AI Systems from First Principles**\n",
      "A trend toward understanding AI tools \"from scratch\" rather than relying solely on high-level frameworks. The article advocates working directly with foundation model APIs to gain deeper understanding of how agentic systems actually work.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 3. **Self-Correction and Iterative Refinement Techniques**\n",
      "Key methodologies cited include:\n",
      "- **Self-Refine** (self-feedback loops)\n",
      "- **Reflexion** (verbal reinforcement learning)\n",
      "- **CRITIC** (tool-interactive critiquing with external feedback)\n",
      "- **ReAct** (combining reasoning and acting)\n",
      "\n",
      "These approaches show 10-30% performance improvements across diverse tasks.\n",

      "Arthur C. Clarke’s Third Law says that “*any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic*”. That’s exactly how a lot of today’s AI frameworks feel. Tools like GitHub Copilot, Claude Desktop, OpenAI Operator, and Perplexity Comet are automating everyday tasks that would’ve seemed impossible to automate just five years ago. What’s even more remarkable is that with just a few lines of code, we can build our own sophisticated AI tools: ones that search through files, browse the web, click links, and even make purchases. It really does feel like magic.\n",

      "Even though I [genuinely believe in data wizards](https://towardsdatascience.com/i-think-of-analysts-as-data-wizards-who-help-their-product-teams-solve-problems/), I don’t believe in magic. I find it exciting (and often helpful) to understand how things are actually built and what’s happening under the hood. That’s why I’ve decided to share a series of posts on agentic AI design concepts that’ll help you understand how all these magical tools actually work.\n",
      "\n",
      "To gain a deep understanding, we’ll build a multi-AI agent system from scratch. We’ll avoid using frameworks like CrewAI or smolagents and instead work directly with the foundation model API. Along the way, we’ll explore the fundamental agentic design patterns: reflection, tool use, planning, and multi-agent setups. Then, we’ll combine all this knowledge to build a multi-AI agent system that can answer complex data-related questions.\n",

      "# Key AI Trends and Concepts from the Article\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on this 2025 article, here are the main AI trends and concepts discussed:\n",
      "\n",
      "## 1. **Agentic AI and Reflection Design Pattern**\n",
      "The core focus is on **reflection** as a fundamental agentic design pattern where LLMs iteratively review and improve their outputs through feedback loops, mimicking human work processes. This enables AI agents to self-critique and refine results rather than generating responses in a single pass.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 2. **Building AI Systems from First Principles**\n",
      "A trend toward understanding AI tools \"from scratch\" rather than relying solely on high-level frameworks. The article advocates working directly with foundation model APIs to gain deeper understanding of how agentic systems actually work.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 3. **Self-Correction and Iterative Refinement Techniques**\n",
      "Key methodologies cited include:\n",
      "- **Self-Refine** (self-feedback loops)\n",
      "- **Reflexion** (verbal reinforcement learning)\n",
      "- **CRITIC** (tool-interactive critiquing with external feedback)\n",
      "- **ReAct** (combining reasoning and acting)\n",
      "\n",
      "These approaches show 10-30% performance improvements across diverse tasks.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 4. **Popular Agentic AI Frameworks**\n",
      "Mentioned tools and frameworks include: GitHub Copilot, Claude Desktop, OpenAI Operator, Perplexity Comet, CrewAI, smolagents, DSPy, and LangGraph.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 5. **Production Trade-offs: Quality vs. Cost/Latency**\n",
      "Recognition that reflection's quality improvements must be balanced against increased API calls, latency, and costs—a key consideration for real-world business applications.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Beyond Prompting: The Power of Context Engineering\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "# Key AI Trends and Concepts from the Article\n",
      "\n",
      "## 1. **Context Engineering as a Discipline**\n",
      "A systematic approach to optimizing what information goes into an LLM's prompt, positioning itself as a cost-effective alternative to fine-tuning. Focuses on making \"self-improving\" systems that learn from experience without retraining model parameters.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 2. **Evolution from Static to Self-Improving Contexts**\n",
      "Progression through three stages:\n",
      "- **Static prompting** (hand-crafted, fixed instructions)\n",
      "- **Dynamic retrieval** (RAG - Retrieval-Augmented Generation)\n",
      "- **Self-improving contexts** (adaptive systems that update based on past performance)\n",
      "\n",
      "## 3. **Agentic Context Engineering (ACE) Framework**\n",
      "A novel 2025 approach that addresses \"brevity bias\" and \"context collapse\" through:\n",
      "- Structured \"playbook\" of reusable knowledge bullets with metadata\n",
      "- Three-component loop: Generator → Reflector → Curator\n",
      "- Incremental delta updates rather than full prompt rewrites\n",
      "- 83.6% lower token costs with +10.6% performance improvement on benchmarks\n",
      "\n",
      "## 4. **Natural Language-Based Learning Methods**\n",
      "Emergence of frameworks using verbal/textual feedback instead of gradient-based updates:\n",
      "- **Reflexion** - learning through natural language reflection\n",
      "- **TextGrad** - \"backpropagation\" using textual critiques\n",
      "- **GEPA** - evolutionary algorithms with prompt mutation and selection\n",
      "\n",
      "## 5. **Test-Time Learning and Adaptive Memory**\n",
      "Systems that accumulate and reuse knowledge during inference without explicit retraining, enabling continuous improvement through persistent memory mechanisms.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Can LLMs Replace Data Analysts? Building An LLM-Powered Analyst\n",

      "Based on this article, here are the main AI trends and concepts discussed:\n",
      "\n",
      "## 1. **LLM Agents and Agentic AI**\n",
      "The article introduces **LLM agents** as a paradigm shift from predefined workflows to autonomous reasoning systems. Instead of hardcoding every step, agents use LLMs as a \"reasoning engine\" to dynamically choose actions and determine when to return final answers—mirroring how human analysts work.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 2. **Tool-Using LLMs (Function Calling)**\n",
      "The article focuses on **OpenAI function calling** as a critical capability that allows LLMs to interact with external systems. This enables LLMs to invoke tools like SQL executors, calculators, or search engines, bridging the gap between language models and real-world data systems.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 3. **Structured Output via Function Calling**\n",
      "Two key use cases for functions are highlighted:\n",
      "- **Tagging & Extraction**: Using function calls to ensure structured, validated output formats instead of unstructured text\n",
      "- **Tools & Routing**: Enabling agent-like behavior where LLMs can select and execute appropriate tools\n",
      "\n",
      "## 4. **Pydantic for Schema Definition**\n",

      "In [the previous article](https://towardsdatascience.com/topic-modelling-using-chatgpt-api-8775b0891d16), we discussed how to do Topic Modelling using ChatGPT and got excellent results. The task was to look at customer reviews for hotel chains and define the main topics mentioned in the reviews.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the previous iteration, we used standard [ChatGPT completions API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/gpt/chat-completions-api) and sent raw prompts ourselves. Such an approach works well when we are doing some ad-hoc analytical research.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, if your team is actively using and monitoring customer reviews, it’s worth considering some automatisation. A good automatisation will not only help you build an autonomous pipeline, but it will also be more convenient (even team members unfamiliar with LLMs and coding will be able to access this data) and more cost-effective (you will send all texts to LLM and pay only once).\n",
      "\n",
      "Suppose we are building a sustainable production-ready service. In that case, it’s worth leveraging existing frameworks to reduce the amount of glue code and have a more modular solution (so that we could easily switch, for example, from one LLM to another).\n",
      "\n",
      "In this article, I would like to tell you about one of the most popular frameworks for LLM applications – [LangChain](https://www.langchain.com). Also, we will understand in detail how to evaluate your model’s performance since it’s a crucial step for business applications.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Nuances of production process\n",
      "\n",
      "### Revising initial approach\n",
      "\n",
      "First, let’s revise our previous approach for ad-hoc Topic Modelling with ChatGPT.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Step 1: Get a representative sample.**\n",
      "\n",
      "We want to determine the list of topics we will use for our markup. The most straightforward way is to send all reviews and ask LLM to define the list of 20–30 topics mentioned in our reviews. Unfortunately, we won’t be able to do it since it won’t fit the context size. We could use a map-reduce approach, but it could be costly. That’s why we would like to define a representative sample.\n",
      "\n",
      "For this, we [built](https://towardsdatascience.com/topic-modelling-using-chatgpt-api-8775b0891d16) a [BERTopic](https://maartengr.github.io/BERTopic/getting_started/quickstart/quickstart.html) topic model and got the most representative reviews for each topic.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Step 2: Determine the list of topics we will use for markup.**\n",
      "\n",
      "The next step is to pass all the selected texts to ChatGPT and ask it to define a list of topics mentioned in these reviews. Then, we can use these topics for later markup.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Step 3: Doing topics’ markup in batches.**\n",
      "\n",
      "The last step is the most straightforward – we can send customer reviews in batches that fit the context size and ask LLM to return topics for each customer review.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, with these three steps, we could determine the list of relevant topics for our texts and classify them all.\n",
      "\n",
      "It works perfectly for one-time research. However, we are missing some bits for an excellent production-ready solution.\n",
      "\n",
      "### From ad-hoc to production\n",
      "\n",
      "Let’s discuss what improvements we could make to our initial ad-hoc approach.\n",
      "\n",
      "* In the previous approach, we have a static list of topics. But in real-life examples, new topics might arise over time, for example, if you launch a new feature. So, we need a feedback loop to update the list of topics we are using. The easiest way to do it is to capture the list of reviews without any assigned topics and regularly run topic modelling on them.\n",
      "* If we are doing one-time research, we can validate the results of the topics’ assignments manually. But for the process that is running in production, we need to think about a continuous evaluation.\n",
      "* If we are building a pipeline for customer review analysis, we should consider more potential use cases and store other related information we might need. For example, it’s helpful to store translated versions of customer reviews so that our colleagues don’t have to use Google Translate all the time. Also, sentiment and other features (for example, products mentioned in the customer review) might be valuable for analysis and filtering.\n",
      "* The LLM industry is progressing quite quickly right now, and everything is changing all the time. It’s worth considering a modular approach where we can quickly iterate and try new approaches over time without rewriting the whole service from scratch.\n",
      "\n",
      "![Scheme of the service by author](https://towardsdatascience.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1ejZtJuZ2xxJpZFjbRPsi8g.jpeg)\n",
      "\n",
      "Scheme of the service by author\n",
      "\n",
      "We have a lot of ideas on what to do with our topic modelling service. But let’s focus on the main parts: modular approach instead of API calls and evaluation. The LangChain framework will help us with both topics, so let’s learn more about it.\n",
      "\n",
      "## LangChain Basics\n",
      "\n",
      "[LangChain](https://python.langchain.com/docs/get_started/introduction) is a framework for building applications powered by Language Models. Here are the main [components](https://docs.langchain.com/docs/category/components) of LangChain:\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Schema** is the most basic classes like Documents, Chat Messages and Texts.\n",
      "* **Models**. LangChain provides access to LLMs, Chat Models and Text Embedding models that you could easily use in your applications and switch between them if needed. It goes without saying it supports such popular models like ChatGPT, Anthropic and Llama.\n",
      "* **Prompts** is a functionality to help work with prompts, including prompt templates, output parsers and example selectors for few-shot prompting.\n",
      "* **Chains** are the core of LangChain (as you might guess by the name). Chains help you to build a sequence of blocks that will be executed. You can truly appreciate this functionality if you’re building a complex application.\n",
      "* **Indexes**: document loaders, text splitters, vector stores and retrievers. This module provides tools that help LLMs to interact with your documents. This functionality would be valuable if you’re building a Q&A use case. We won’t be using this functionality much in our example today.\n",
      "* LangChain provides a whole set of methods to manage and limit **memory**. This functionality is primarily needed for ChatBot scenarios.\n",
      "* One of the latest and most powerful features is **agents**. If you are a heavy ChatGPT user, you must have heard about the plugins. It’s the same idea that you can empower LLM with a set of custom or predefined tools (like Google Search or Wikipedia), and then the agent can use them while answering your questions. In this setup, LLM is acting like a reasoning agent and decides what it needs to do to achieve the result and when it gets the final answer that it could share. It’s exciting functionality, so it’s definitely worth a separate discussion.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, LangChain can help us build modular applications and be able to switch between different components (for example, from ChatGPT to Anthropic or from CSV as data input to Snowflake DB). LangChain has more than [190 integrations](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/providers), so that it can save you quite a lot of time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, we could reuse ready-made chains for [some use cases](https://python.langchain.com/docs/use_cases) instead of starting from scratch.\n",
      "\n",
      "When calling ChatGPT API manually, we have to manage quite a lot of Python glue code to make it work. It’s not a problem when you’re working on a small, straightforward task, but it might become unmanageable when you need to build something more complex and convoluted. In such cases, LangChain may help you eliminate this glue code and create more easy-to-maintain modular code.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, LangChain has its own limitations:\n",
      "\n",
      "* It’s primarily focused on OpenAI models, so it might not work so smoothly with on-premise open-source models.\n",
      "* The flip side of convenience is that it’s not easy to understand what’s going on under the hood and when and how the ChatGPT API you’re paying for is executed. You can use debug mode, but you need to specify it and go through the complete logs for a clearer view.\n",
      "* Despite pretty good documentation, I struggle from time to time to find answers to my questions. There are not so many other tutorials and resources on the internet apart from the official documentation, quite frequently you can see only official pages in Google.\n",
      "* The Langchain library is progressing a lot, and the team constantly ship new features. So, the library is not mature, and you might have to switch from the functionality you’re using. For example, the `SequentialChain` class is considered legacy now and might be deprecated in the future since they’ve introduced [LCEL](https://python.langchain.com/docs/expression_language/) – we will talk about it in more detail later on.\n",

      "### Loading documents\n",
      "\n",
      "To work with the customers’ reviews, we first need to load them. For that, we could use [Document Loaders](https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/data_connection/document_loaders/). In our case, customer reviews are stored as a set of .txt files in a Directory, but you can effortlessly load docs from third-party tools. For example, there’s an [integration](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/document_loaders/snowflake) with Snowflake.\n",
      "\n",
      "We will use `DirectoryLoader` to load all files in the directory since we have separate files from hotels. For each file, we will specify `TextLoader` as a loader (by default, a loader for unstructured documents is used). Our files are encoded in `ISO-8859–1`, so the default call returns an error. However, LangChain can automatically detect used encoding. With such a setup, it works ok.\n",
      "\n",

      "len(docs)\n",
      "82\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "### Splitting documents\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, we would like to split our documents. We know that each file consists of a set of customer comments delimited by `n`. Since our case is very straightforward, we will use the most basic `CharacterTextSplitter` that splits documents by character. When working with real documents (whole long texts instead of independent short comments), it’s better to use [Recursive split by character](https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/data_connection/document_transformers/text_splitters/recursive_text_splitter) since it allows you to split documents into chunks smarter.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, LangChain is more suited for fuzzy text splitting. So, I had to hack it a bit to make it work the way I wanted.\n",
      "\n",
      "How it works:\n",
      "\n",
      "* You specify `chunk_size` and `chunk_overlap`, and it tries to make the minimal number of splits so that each chunk is smaller than `chunk_size`. If it fails to create a small enough chunk, it prints a message to the Jupyter Notebook output.\n",
      "* If you specify too big `chunk_size`, not all comments will be separated.\n",
      "* If you specify too small `chunk_size`, you will have print statements for each comment in your output, leading to the Notebook reloading. Unfortunately, I couldn’t find any parameters to switch it off.\n",
      "\n",
      "To overcome this problem, I specified `length_function` as a constant equal to `chunk_size`. Then I got just a standard split by character. LangChain provides enough flexibility to do what you want, but only in a somewhat hacky way.\n",
      "\n",
      "```wp-block-prismatic-blocks\n",
      "from langchain.text_splitter import CharacterTextSplitter\n",
      "\n",
      "text_splitter = CharacterTextSplitter(\n",
      "    separator = \"n\",\n",
      "    chunk_size = 1,\n",
      "    chunk_overlap  = 0,\n",
      "    length_function = lambda x: 1, # usually len is used \n",
      "    is_separator_regex = False\n",
      ")\n",
      "split_docs = text_splitter.split_documents(docs)\n",
      "len(split_docs) \n",
      "12890\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, let’s add the document ID to the metadata – we will use it later.\n",
      "\n",
      "```wp-block-prismatic-blocks\n",
      "for i in range(len(split_docs)):\n",
      "    split_docs[i].metadata['id'] = i\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "The advantage of using Documents is that we now have automatic data sources and can filter data by it. For example, we can filter only comments related to Travelodge Hotel.\n",
      "\n",
      "```wp-block-prismatic-blocks\n",
      "list(filter(\n",
      "    lambda x: 'travelodge' in x.metadata['source'],\n",
      "    split_docs\n",
      "))\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, we need a model. As we discussed earlier in LangChain, there are LLMs and Chat Models. The main difference is that LLMs take texts and return texts, while Chat Models are more suitable for conversational use cases and can get a set of messages as input. In our case, we will use the ChatModel for OpenAI since we would like to pass system messages as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "```wp-block-prismatic-blocks\n",
      "from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI\n",

      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "### Prompts\n",
      "\n",
      "Let’s move on to the most important part – our prompt. In LangChain, there’s a concept of Prompt Templates. They help to reuse prompts parametrised by variables. It’s helpful since, in real-life applications, prompts might be very detailed and sophisticated. So, prompt templates can be a useful high-level abstraction that would help you to manage your code effectively.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since we are going to use the Chat Model, we will need [ChatPromptTemplate.](https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/model_io/prompts/prompt_templates/#chatprompttemplate)\n",
      "\n",
      "But before jumping into prompts, let’s briefly discuss a helpful feature – an output parser. Surprisingly, they can help us to create an effective prompt. We can define the desired output, generate an output parser and then use the parser to create instructions for the prompt.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let’s define what we would like to see in the output. First, we would like to be able to pass a list of customer reviews to the prompt to process them in batches, so in the result, we would like to get a list with the following parameters:\n",
      "\n",
      "* id to identify documents,\n",
      "* list of topics from the predefined list (we will be using the list from our previous iteration),\n",
      "* sentiment (negative, neutral or positive).\n",
      "\n",
      "Let’s specify our output parser. Since we need a pretty complex JSON structure, we will use [Pydantic Output Parser](https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/model_io/output_parsers/pydantic) instead of the most commonly used [Structured Output Parser](https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/model_io/output_parsers/structured).\n",
      "\n",

      "Article Title: Production-Ready LLMs Made Simple with the NeMo Agent Toolkit\n",
      "\n",
      "Article Content (excerpt):\n",
      "When I saw that Nvidia had launched its own LLM agent framework, the [NeMo Agent Toolkit](https://docs.nvidia.com/nemo/agent-toolkit/latest/index.html) (or NAT), I got really excited. We usually think of Nvidia as the company powering the entire LLM hype with its GPUs, so it’s fascinating to see them go beyond hardware and step into the software space as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are already plenty of LLM agent frameworks out there: [LangGraph](https://towardsdatascience.com/from-basics-to-advanced-exploring-langgraph-e8c1cf4db787/), [smolagents](https://towardsdatascience.com/code-agents-the-future-of-agentic-ai/), [CrewAI](https://towardsdatascience.com/multi-ai-agent-systems-101-bac58e3bcc47/) and [DSPy](https://towardsdatascience.com/programming-not-prompting-a-hands-on-guide-to-dspy/), just to name a few. The [NeMo Agent Toolkit](https://docs.nvidia.com/nemo/agent-toolkit/latest/index.html), however, feels a bit different. I would describe it as a kind of glue that helps stitch all the pieces together and turn them into a production-ready solution.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nvidia positions this framework as a way to tackle “day 2” problems: exposing agents as APIs, adding observability to monitor your system and investigate edge cases, building evaluations, and reusing agents created in other frameworks.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this article, I’ll explore the core capabilities of the NeMo Agent Toolkit in practice, starting with a simple chat-completion app and gradually moving toward a hierarchical agentic setup, where one LLM agent can recursively use other agents as tools. Since it’s the festive season, I’ll be using publicly available data from the [World Happiness Report](https://worldhappiness.report/) to keep things cheerful.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Setting up\n",
      "\n",
      "As usual, we will start by setting up the environment and installing the package.\n",
      "\n",
      "The core package itself is fairly lightweight. However, as I mentioned earlier, NAT is designed to act as glue allowing to integrate with different LLM frameworks in your workflow. Because of that, there are several optional plugins available for popular libraries such as LangChain, CrewAI, and LlamaIndex. You can always find the most up-to-date list of supported plugins in [the official documentation](https://docs.nvidia.com/nemo/agent-toolkit/latest/quick-start/installing.html).   \n",
      "In this article, we will be using LangChain, so we’ll need to install the corresponding extension as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "> ***Tip:** NAT works MUCH better and faster with `uv`. I initially tried installing everything with `pip`, and it failed after about 20 minutes of waiting. I’d strongly recommend not repeating my mistakes.*\n",
      "\n",
      "First, create and activate a virtual environment using `uv`.\n",
      "\n",
      "```wp-block-prismatic-blocks\n",
      "uv venv .venv_nat_uv --python 3.12\n",
      "source .venv_nat_uv/bin/activate\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "Then install NAT with the LangChain plugin.\n",
      "\n",
      "```wp-block-prismatic-blocks\n",
      "uv pip install \"nvidia-nat[langchain]\"\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "If you’re planning to run NAT from the CLI, you’ll also need to export the relevant environment variables. Since I’ll be using Anthropic models, I need to set the API key.\n",
      "\n",
      "```wp-block-prismatic-blocks\n",
      "export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=<your_api_key>\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "## Loading data\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, let’s download the World Happiness Report data and take a closer look at it. I’ve put together a small helper function to load the dataset and slightly clean up the data.\n",
      "\n",
      "```wp-block-prismatic-blocks\n",
      "import pandas as pd\n",
      "def load_data():\n",
      "    df = pd.read_excel('whr2025_data.xlsx')\n",
      "    df = df[df.Year >= 2019]\n",
      "    df = df.drop(['Lower whisker', 'Upper whisker'], axis=1)\n",

      "df = load_data()\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "This dataset covers the World Happiness Report results from2019 to 2024. For each country and year, it includes the overall happiness score as well as the estimated contribution of several underlying factors:\n",
      "\n",
      "* logarithm of GDP per capita,\n",
      "* social support,\n",
      "* healthy life expectancy,\n",
      "* freedom to make life choices,\n",
      "* generosity,\n",
      "* perception of corruption.\n",
      "\n",
      "With this dataset, we will be able to investigate happiness patterns across geographies and over time and hopefully spot some interesting patterns along the way.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Chat completion example\n",
      "\n",
      "Let’s start with a very simple chat-completion example. The architecture here is intentionally minimal: a single LLM with no additional tools or agents involved.\n",
      "\n",
      "![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*nZxkqfnlP_GaOOHeNbBpNQ.png)\n",
      "\n",
      "Image by author\n",
      "\n",
      "The NeMo Agent Toolkit is configured via YAML files that define both the workflow and the underlying LLMs. Nvidia chose this approach because it makes experimenting with different configurations much easier. For this first example, we’ll create a `chat_config.yml` file.\n",
      "\n",
      "At a high level, our config file will consist of two main sections:\n",
      "\n",
      "* `llms` where we define the language models we want to use,\n",
      "* `workflow` where we describe how those models are wired together and how the agent behaves.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the LLM side, NAT supports several providers out of the box, including OpenAI, Nvidia Inference Microservices, and AWS Bedrock. Since I want to use an Anthropic model, the easiest option here is [LiteLLM](https://docs.nvidia.com/nemo/agent-toolkit/latest/workflows/llms/index.html#litellm), which acts as a universal wrapper and lets us connect to virtually any provider.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the `workflow` section, we will specify:\n",
      "\n",
      "* the workflow type (we will be using the simplest `chat_completion` for now, but will explore more complex agentic setups later),\n",
      "* the LLM defined above, and\n",
      "* the system prompt that sets the agent’s behaviour.\n",

      "The NeMo Agent Toolkit (NAT) represents a shift toward frameworks designed specifically for \"day 2\" problems - moving beyond prototyping to production deployment with features like API exposure, observability, monitoring, and evaluation systems.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 2. **Framework Interoperability and Integration**\n",
      "Rather than being another standalone framework, NAT acts as \"glue\" that integrates with existing popular frameworks (LangGraph, LangChain, CrewAI, LlamaIndex, DSPy), highlighting a trend toward composable, multi-framework AI architectures.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 3. **Agentic AI with Tool Use**\n",
      "The article demonstrates the evolution from simple chat completion to tool-equipped agents that can access and analyze real data, representing the broader shift toward functional agents that can take actions rather than just generate text.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 4. **Configuration-Driven AI Development**\n",
      "NAT's YAML-based configuration approach for defining workflows, LLMs, and agent behaviors represents a trend toward declarative, infrastructure-as-code practices in AI development, making experimentation and deployment more reproducible.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 5. **Hardware Companies Expanding into AI Software**\n",
      "Nvidia's move from GPU hardware into the AI software/framework space illustrates a broader trend of infrastructure providers building vertical integration into the AI stack to capture more value and ensure optimal performance.\u001b[0m\n",

      "\n",
      "Article Content (excerpt):\n",
      "Having spent over a decade working in analytics, I firmly believe that observability and evaluation are essential for any LLM application running in production. Monitoring and metrics aren’t just nice-to-haves. They ensure your product is functioning as expected and that each new update is actually moving you in the right direction.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this article, I want to share my experience with the observability and evaluation features of the NeMo Agent Toolkit (NAT). If you haven’t read [my previous article](https://towardsdatascience.com/production-ready-llms-made-simple-with-nemo-agent-toolkit/) on NAT, here’s a quick refresher: NAT is Nvidia’s framework for building production-ready LLM applications. Think of it as the glue that connects LLMs, tools, and workflows, while also offering deployment and observability options.\n",
      "\n",
      "Using NAT, we built a Happiness Agent capable of answering nuanced questions about [the World Happiness report data](https://www.worldhappiness.report/) and performing calculations based on real metrics. Our focus was on building agentic flows, integrating agents from other frameworks as tools (in our example, a LangGraph-based calculator agent), and deploying the application both as a REST API and a user-friendly interface.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this article, I’ll dive into my favourite topics: observability and evaluations. After all, as the saying goes, you can’t improve what you don’t measure. So, without further ado, let’s jump in.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Observability\n",
      "\n",
      "Let’s start with observability — the ability to track what’s happening inside your application, including all intermediate steps, tools used, timings, and token usage. The NeMo Agent Toolkit integrates with a variety of observability tools such as Phoenix, W&B Weave, and Catalyst. You can always check the latest list of supported frameworks in [the documentation](https://docs.nvidia.com/nemo/agent-toolkit/latest/workflows/observe/index.html).\n",
      "\n",
      "For this article, we’ll try Phoenix. [Phoenix](https://phoenix.arize.com/) is an open-source platform for tracing and evaluating LLMs. Before we can start using it, we first need to install the plugin.\n",
      "\n",
      "```wp-block-prismatic-blocks\n",
      "uv pip install arize-phoenix\n",
      "uv pip install \"nvidia-nat[phoenix]\"\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, we can launch the Phoenix server.\n",
      "\n",
      "```wp-block-prismatic-blocks\n",
      "phoenix server\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "Once it’s running, the tracing service will be available at `http://localhost:6006/v1/traces`. At this point, you’ll see a default project since we haven’t sent any data yet.\n",

      "\n",
      "Image by author\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, that the Phoenix server is running, let’s see how we can start using it. Since NAT is based on YAML configuration, all we need to do is add a telemetry section to our config. You can find the config and full agent implementation on [GitHub](https://github.com/miptgirl/miptgirl_medium/blob/main/nat_example/happiness_v3/src/happiness_v3/configs/config.yml).

      "## LLM basics\n",
      "\n",
      "Before jumping into our task, let’s discuss the basics of LLMs and how they could be used.\n",
      "\n",
      "Large Language Models are trained on enormous amounts of text to predict the next word for the sentence. It’s a straightforward supervised Machine Learning task: we have the set of the sentences’ beginnings and the following words for them.\n",
      "\n",
      "![Graph by author](https://towardsdatascience.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1TI8V97vrVyWBFIpIslASJQ.png)\n",
      "\n",
      "Graph by author\n",
      "\n",
      "You can play with a basic LLM, for example, `text-davinci-003`, on [nat.dev](https://nat.dev/).\n",
      "\n",
      "In most business applications, we need not a generic model but one that can solve problems. Basic LLMs are not perfect for such tasks because they are trained to predict the most likely next word. But on the internet, there are a lot of texts where the next word is not a correct answer, for example, jokes or just a list of questions to prepare for the exam.\n",
      "\n",
      "That’s why, nowadays, Instruction Tuned LLMs are very popular for business cases. These models are basic LLMs, fine-tuned on datasets with instructions and good answers (for example, [OpenOrca dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Open-Orca/OpenOrca)). Also, RLHF (Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback) approach is often used to train such models.\n",
      "\n",
      "The other important feature of Instruction Tuned LLMs is that they are trying to be helpful, honest and harmless, which is crucial for the models that will communicate with customers (especially vulnerable ones).\n",
      "\n",
      "## What are the primary tasks for LLMs\n",
      "\n",
      "LLMs are primarily used for tasks with unstructured data (not the cases when you have a table with lots of numbers). Here is the list of the most common applications for texts:\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Summarisation** – giving a concise overview of the text.\n",
      "* **Text analysis**, for example, sentiment analysis or extracting specific features (for example, labels mentioned in hotel reviews).\n",
      "* **Text transformations** include translating to different languages, changing tone, or formatting from HTML to JSON.\n",
      "* **Generation**, for example, to generate a story from a prompt, respond to customer questions or help to brainstorm about some problem.\n",
      "\n",
      "It looks like our task of topic modelling is the one where LLMs could be rather beneficial. It’s an example of **Text analysis**.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Prompt Engineering 101\n",
      "\n",
      "We give tasks to LLMs using instructions that are often called prompts. You can think of LLM as a very motivated and knowledgeable junior specialist who is ready to help but needs clear instructions to follow. So, a prompt is critical.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are a few main principles that you should take into account while creating prompts.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Principle #1: Be as clear and specific as possible\n",
      "\n",
      "* Use delimiters to split different sections of your prompt, for example, separating different steps in the instruction or framing user message. The common delimeters are `\"\"\"` , `---` , `###` , `<>` or XML tags.\n",
      "* Define the format for the output. For example, you could use JSON or HTML and even specify a list of possible values. It will make response parsing much easier for you.\n",
      "* Show a couple of input & output examples to the model so it can see what you expect as separate messages. Such an approach is called few-shot prompting.\n",
      "* Also, it could be helpful to instruct the model to check assumptions and conditions. For example, to ensure that the output format is JSON and returned values are from the specified list.\n",
      "\n",
      "### **Principle #2:** Push the model to think about the answer\n",
      "\n",
      "Daniel Kahneman’s famous book \"Thinking Fast and Slow\" shows that our mind consists of 2 systems. System 1 works instinctively and allows us to give answers extremely quickly and with minimal effort (this system helped our ancestors to survive after meeting tigers). System 2 requires more time and concentration to get an answer. We tend to use System 1 in as many situations as possible because it’s more effective for basic tasks. Surprisingly, LLMs do the same and often jump to conclusions.\n",
      "\n",
      "We can push the model to think before answering and increase the quality.\n",
      "\n",
      "* We can give a model step-by-step instructions to force it to go through all the steps and don’t rush to conclusions. This approach is called \"Chain of thought\" reasoning.\n",
      "* The other approach is to split your complex task into smaller ones and use different prompts for each elementary step. Such an approach has multiple advantages: it’s easier to support this code (good analogy: spaghetti code vs. modular one); it may be less costly (you don’t need to write long instructions for all possible cases); you can augment external tools at specific points of the workflow or include human in the loop.\n",
      "* With the above approaches, we don’t need to share all the reasoning with the end user. We can just keep it as an inner monologue.\n",
      "* Suppose we want the model to check some results (for example, from the other model or students). In that case, we can ask it to independently get the result first or evaluate it against the list of criteria before coming to conclusions.\n",
      "\n",
      "You can find an example of a helpful system prompt from Jeremy Howard that pushes the model to reason in [this jupyter notebook](https://github.com/fastai/lm-hackers/blob/main/lm-hackers.ipynb).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Principle #3: Beware hallucinations\n",
      "\n",
      "The well-known problem of LLMs is hallucinations. It’s when a model tells you information that looks plausible but not true.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, if you ask GPT to provide the most popular papers on DALL-E 3, two out of three URLs are invalid.\n",
      "\n",
      "![](https://towardsdatascience.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1CS2V_Xhzau_hRM91mlKmEw.png)\n",
      "\n",
      "The common sources of hallucinations:\n",
      "\n",
      "* The model doesn’t see many URLs, and it doesn’t know much about it. So, it tends to create fake URLs.\n",
      "* It doesn’t know about itself (because there was no info about GPT-4 when the model was pre-trained).\n",
      "* The model doesn’t have real-time data and will likely tell you something random if you ask about recent events.\n",
      "\n",
      "To reduce hallucinations, you can try the following approaches:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Ask the model to link the answer to the relevant information from the context, then answer the question based on the found data.\n",
      "* In the end, ask the model to validate the result based on provided factual information.\n",
      "\n",
      "> Remember that Prompt Engineering is an iterative process. It’s unlikely that you will be able to solve your task ideally from the first attempt. It’s worth trying multiple prompts on a set of example inputs.\n",
      "\n",
      "The other thought-provoking idea about LLM answers’ quality is that if the model starts to tell you absurd or non-relevant things, it’s likely to proceed. Because, on the internet, if you see a thread where nonsense is discussed, the following discussion will likely be of poor quality. So, if you’re using the model in a chat mode (passing the previous conversation as the context), it might be worth starting from scratch.\n",
      "\n",
      "## ChatGPT API\n",
      "\n",
      "ChatGPT from OpenAI is one of the most popular LLMs now, so for this example, we will be using ChatGPT API.\n",
      "\n",
      "For now, GPT-4 is the best-performing LLM we have (according to [fasteval](https://fasteval.github.io/FastEval/)). However, it may be enough for non-chat tasks to use the previous version, GPT-3.5.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Setting up account\n",
      "\n",
      "To use ChatGPT API, you need to register on [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com/). As usual, you can use authentication from Google. Keep in mind that ChatGPT API access is not related to the ChatGPT Plus subscription you might have.\n",
      "\n",
      "After registration, you also need to top up your balance. Since you will pay for API calls as you go. You can do it at the \"Billing\" tab. The process is straightforward: you need to fill in your card details and the initial amount you are ready to pay.\n",
      "\n",
      "The last important step is to create an API Key (a secret key you will use to access API). You can do it at the \"API Keys\" tab. Ensure you save the key since you won’t be able to access it afterwards. However, you can create a new key if you’ve lost the previous one.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Pricing\n",
      "\n",
      "As I mentioned, you will be paying for API calls, so understanding how it works is worth it. I advise you to look through [the Pricing documentation](https://openai.com/pricing) for the most up-to-date info.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, the price depends on the model and the number of tokens. The more complex model would cost you more: ChatGPT 4 is more expensive than ChatGPT 3.5, and ChatGPT 3.5 with 16K context is more costly than ChatGPT 3.5 with 4K context. You will also have slightly different prices for input tokens (your prompt) and output (model response).\n",
      "\n",
      "However, all prices are for 1K tokens, so one of the main factors is the size of your input and output.\n",
      "\n",

      "**MCP (Model Context Protocol)** is a method to standardise communication between AI applications and external tools or data sources. This standardisation helps to reduce the number of integrations needed (*from N\\*M to N+M*):\n",
      "\n",
      "* You can use community-built MCP servers when you need common functionality, saving time and avoiding the need to reinvent the wheel every time.\n",
      "* You can also expose your own tools and resources, making them available for others to use.\n",
      "\n",
      "In [my previous article](https://towardsdatascience.com/your-personal-analytics-toolbox/), we built the analytics toolbox (a collection of tools that might automate your day-to-day routine). We built an MCP server and used its capabilities with existing clients like MCP Inspector or Claude Desktop.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, we want to use those tools directly in our AI applications. To do that, let’s build our own MCP client. We will write fairly low-level code, which will also give you a clearer picture of how tools like Claude Code interact with MCP under the hood.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, I would like to implement the feature that is currently (*July 2025*) missing from Claude Desktop: the ability for the LLM to automatically check whether it has a suitable prompt template for the task at hand and use it. Right now, you have to pick the template manually, which isn’t very convenient.\n",

      "As a bonus, I will also share a high-level implementation using the smolagents framework, which is ideal for scenarios when you work only with MCP tools and don’t need much customisation.\n",

      "\n",
      "## 1. **Model Context Protocol (MCP) - Standardization of AI Integrations**\n",
      "The article centers on MCP, Anthropic's protocol for standardizing how LLMs interact with external tools and data sources. This represents a shift toward reducing integration complexity from N×M to N+M connections, enabling reusable, community-built servers and promoting interoperability across AI applications.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 2. **Client-Server Architecture for AI Applications**\n",
      "The article demonstrates the three-component MCP architecture:\n",
      "- **Host** (user-facing application)\n",
      "- **MCP Client** (connection layer)\n",
      "- **MCP Server** (exposes tools, prompts, and resources)\n",
      "\n",
      "This pattern represents an emerging trend of modular, protocol-based AI system design rather than monolithic applications.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 3. **Autonomous Tool Selection and Dynamic Prompt Templates**\n",
      "A notable feature discussed is automatic prompt template selection—enabling the LLM to independently determine and apply appropriate prompt templates for tasks, rather than requiring manual user selection. This reflects the broader trend toward more autonomous AI agents.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 4. **Low-Level AI Agent Implementation vs. High-Level Frameworks**\n",
      "The article contrasts building custom MCP clients from scratch (for understanding and customization) with using frameworks like **smolagents** for rapid development when working exclusively with MCP tools. This highlights the maturation of the agentic AI ecosystem with multiple abstraction levels.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 5. **Multi-Tool Integration for AI Agents**\n",
      "The practical implementation connects to multiple specialized MCP servers (analytics toolkit, filesystem, web fetch), demonstrating the trend toward AI agents that orchestrate multiple specialized tools rather than single-purpose applications.\u001b[0m\n",

      "--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "# Key AI Trends and Concepts from the Article\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on this 2025 article, here are the main AI trends and concepts discussed:\n",
      "\n",
      "## 1. **Agentic AI and Reflection Design Pattern**\n",
      "The core focus is on **reflection** as a fundamental agentic design pattern where LLMs iteratively review and improve their outputs through feedback loops, mimicking human work processes. This enables AI agents to self-critique and refine results rather than generating responses in a single pass.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 2. **Building AI Systems from First Principles**\n",
      "A trend toward understanding AI tools \"from scratch\" rather than relying solely on high-level frameworks. The article advocates working directly with foundation model APIs to gain deeper understanding of how agentic systems actually work.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 3. **Self-Correction and Iterative Refinement Techniques**\n",
      "Key methodologies cited include:\n",
      "- **Self-Refine** (self-feedback loops)\n",
      "- **Reflexion** (verbal reinforcement learning)\n",
      "- **CRITIC** (tool-interactive critiquing with external feedback)\n",
      "- **ReAct** (combining reasoning and acting)\n",
      "\n",
      "These approaches show 10-30% performance improvements across diverse tasks.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 4. **Popular Agentic AI Frameworks**\n",
      "Mentioned tools and frameworks include: GitHub Copilot, Claude Desktop, OpenAI Operator, Perplexity Comet, CrewAI, smolagents, DSPy, and LangGraph.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 5. **Production Trade-offs: Quality vs. Cost/Latency**\n",
      "Recognition that reflection's quality improvements must be balanced against increased API calls, latency, and costs—a key consideration for real-world business applications.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Beyond Prompting: The Power of Context Engineering\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "# Key AI Trends and Concepts from the Article\n",
      "\n",
      "## 1. **Context Engineering as a Discipline**\n",
      "A systematic approach to optimizing what information goes into an LLM's prompt, positioning itself as a cost-effective alternative to fine-tuning. Focuses on making \"self-improving\" systems that learn from experience without retraining model parameters.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 2. **Evolution from Static to Self-Improving Contexts**\n",
      "Progression through three stages:\n",
      "- **Static prompting** (hand-crafted, fixed instructions)\n",
      "- **Dynamic retrieval** (RAG - Retrieval-Augmented Generation)\n",
      "- **Self-improving contexts** (adaptive systems that update based on past performance)\n",
      "\n",
      "## 3. **Agentic Context Engineering (ACE) Framework**\n",
      "A novel 2025 approach that addresses \"brevity bias\" and \"context collapse\" through:\n",
      "- Structured \"playbook\" of reusable knowledge bullets with metadata\n",
      "- Three-component loop: Generator → Reflector → Curator\n",
      "- Incremental delta updates rather than full prompt rewrites\n",
      "- 83.6% lower token costs with +10.6% performance improvement on benchmarks\n",
      "\n",
      "## 4. **Natural Language-Based Learning Methods**\n",
      "Emergence of frameworks using verbal/textual feedback instead of gradient-based updates:\n",
      "- **Reflexion** - learning through natural language reflection\n",
      "- **TextGrad** - \"backpropagation\" using textual critiques\n",
      "- **GEPA** - evolutionary algorithms with prompt mutation and selection\n",
      "\n",
      "## 5. **Test-Time Learning and Adaptive Memory**\n",
      "Systems that accumulate and reuse knowledge during inference without explicit retraining, enabling continuous improvement through persistent memory mechanisms.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Can LLMs Replace Data Analysts? Building An LLM-Powered Analyst\n",

      "Based on this article, here are the main AI trends and concepts discussed:\n",
      "\n",
      "## 1. **LLM Agents and Agentic AI**\n",
      "The article introduces **LLM agents** as a paradigm shift from predefined workflows to autonomous reasoning systems. Instead of hardcoding every step, agents use LLMs as a \"reasoning engine\" to dynamically choose actions and determine when to return final answers—mirroring how human analysts work.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 2. **Tool-Using LLMs (Function Calling)**\n",
      "The article focuses on **OpenAI function calling** as a critical capability that allows LLMs to interact with external systems. This enables LLMs to invoke tools like SQL executors, calculators, or search engines, bridging the gap between language models and real-world data systems.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 3. **Structured Output via Function Calling**\n",
      "Two key use cases for functions are highlighted:\n",
      "- **Tagging & Extraction**: Using function calls to ensure structured, validated output formats instead of unstructured text\n",
      "- **Tools & Routing**: Enabling agent-like behavior where LLMs can select and execute appropriate tools\n",
      "\n",

      "--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "# Key AI Trends and Concepts from the Article\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on this 2025 article, here are the main AI trends and concepts discussed:\n",
      "\n",
      "## 1. **Agentic AI and Reflection Design Pattern**\n",
      "The core focus is on **reflection** as a fundamental agentic design pattern where LLMs iteratively review and improve their outputs through feedback loops, mimicking human work processes. This enables AI agents to self-critique and refine results rather than generating responses in a single pass.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 2. **Building AI Systems from First Principles**\n",
      "A trend toward understanding AI tools \"from scratch\" rather than relying solely on high-level frameworks. The article advocates working directly with foundation model APIs to gain deeper understanding of how agentic systems actually work.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 3. **Self-Correction and Iterative Refinement Techniques**\n",
      "Key methodologies cited include:\n",
      "- **Self-Refine** (self-feedback loops)\n",
      "- **Reflexion** (verbal reinforcement learning)\n",
      "- **CRITIC** (tool-interactive critiquing with external feedback)\n",
      "- **ReAct** (combining reasoning and acting)\n",
      "\n",
      "These approaches show 10-30% performance improvements across diverse tasks.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 4. **Popular Agentic AI Frameworks**\n",
      "Mentioned tools and frameworks include: GitHub Copilot, Claude Desktop, OpenAI Operator, Perplexity Comet, CrewAI, smolagents, DSPy, and LangGraph.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 5. **Production Trade-offs: Quality vs. Cost/Latency**\n",
      "Recognition that reflection's quality improvements must be balanced against increased API calls, latency, and costs—a key consideration for real-world business applications.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Beyond Prompting: The Power of Context Engineering\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "# Key AI Trends and Concepts from the Article\n",
      "\n",
      "## 1. **Context Engineering as a Discipline**\n",
      "A systematic approach to optimizing what information goes into an LLM's prompt, positioning itself as a cost-effective alternative to fine-tuning. Focuses on making \"self-improving\" systems that learn from experience without retraining model parameters.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 2. **Evolution from Static to Self-Improving Contexts**\n",
      "Progression through three stages:\n",
      "- **Static prompting** (hand-crafted, fixed instructions)\n",
      "- **Dynamic retrieval** (RAG - Retrieval-Augmented Generation)\n",
      "- **Self-improving contexts** (adaptive systems that update based on past performance)\n",
      "\n",
      "## 3. **Agentic Context Engineering (ACE) Framework**\n",
      "A novel 2025 approach that addresses \"brevity bias\" and \"context collapse\" through:\n",
      "- Structured \"playbook\" of reusable knowledge bullets with metadata\n",
