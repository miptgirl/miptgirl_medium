Clarke’s Third Law says that “*any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic*”. That’s exactly how a lot of today’s AI frameworks feel. Tools like GitHub Copilot, Claude Desktop, OpenAI Operator, and Perplexity Comet are automating everyday tasks that would’ve seemed impossible to automate just five years ago. What’s even more remarkable is that with just a few lines of code, we can build our own sophisticated AI tools: ones that search through files, browse the web, click links, and even make purchases. It really does feel like magic.\\n\\nEven though I [genuinely believe in data wizards](https://towardsdatascience.com/i-think-of-analysts-as-data-wizards-who-help-their-product-teams-solve-problems/), I don’t believe in magic. I find it exciting (and often helpful) to understand how things are actually built and what’s happening under the hood. That’s why I’ve decided to share a series of posts on agentic AI design concepts that’ll help you understand how all these magical tools actually work.\\n\\nTo gain a deep understanding, we’ll build a multi-AI agent system from scratch. We’ll avoid using frameworks like CrewAI or smolagents and instead work directly with the foundation model API. Along the way, we’ll explore the fundamental agentic design patterns: reflection, tool use, planning, and multi-agent setups. Then, we’ll combine all this knowledge to build a multi-AI agent system that can answer complex data-related questions.\\n\\nAs Richard Feynman put it, “*What I cannot create, I do not understand*.” So let’s start building!

      "\n",
      "Article Content (excerpt):\n",
      "Initially, when ChatGPT just appeared, we used simple prompts to get answers to our questions. Then, we encountered issues with hallucinations and began using RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) to provide more context to LLMs. After that, we started experimenting with AI agents, where LLMs act as a reasoning engine and can decide what to do next, which tools to use, and when to return the final answer.\n",
      "\n",
      "The next evolutionary step is to create teams of such agents that can collaborate with each other. This approach is logical as it mirrors human interactions. We work in teams where each member has a specific role:\n",
      "\n",
      "* The product manager proposes the next project to work on.\n",
      "* The designer creates its look and feel.\n",
      "* The software engineer develops the solution.\n",
      "* The analyst examines the data to ensure it performs as expected and identifies ways to improve the product for customers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Similarly, we can create a team of AI agents, each focusing on one domain. They can collaborate and reach a final conclusion together. Just as specialization enhances performance in real life, it could also benefit the performance of AI agents.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another advantage of this approach is increased flexibility. Each agent can operate with its own prompt, set of tools and even LLM. For instance, we can use different models for different parts of our system. You can use GPT-4 for the agent that needs more reasoning and GPT-3.5 for the one that does only simple extraction. We can even fine-tune the model for small specific tasks and use it in our crew of agents.\n",
      "\n",
      "The potential drawbacks of this approach are time and cost. Multiple interactions and knowledge sharing between agents require more calls to LLM and consume additional tokens. This could result in longer wait times and increased expenses.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are several frameworks available for multi-agent systems today.\n",
      "Here are some of the most popular ones:\n",
      "\n",
      "* [AutoGen](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen?ref=blog.langchain.dev): Developed by Microsoft, AutoGen uses a conversational approach and was one of the earliest frameworks for multi-agent systems,\n",
      "* [LangGraph](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph): While not strictly a multi-agent framework, LangGraph allows for defining complex interactions between actors using a graph structure. So, it can also be adapted to create multi-agent systems.\n",

      "I’ve decided to start experimenting with multi-agent frameworks from CrewAI since it’s quite widely popular and user friendly. So, it looks like a good option to begin with.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this article, I will walk you through how to use CrewAI. As analysts, we’re the domain experts responsible for documenting various data sources and addressing related questions. We’ll explore how to automate these tasks using multi-agent frameworks.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Setting up the environment\n",
      "\n",
      "Let’s start with setting up the environment. First, we need to install the CrewAI main package and an extension to work with tools.\n",
      "\n",
      "```wp-block-prismatic-blocks\n",
      "pip install crewai\n",
      "pip install 'crewai[tools]'\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "CrewAI was developed to work primarily with OpenAI API, but I would also like to try it with a local model. According to [the ChatBot Arena Leaderboard](https://chat.lmsys.org/?leaderboard), the best model you can run on your laptop is Llama 3 (8b parameters). It will be the most feasible option for our use case.\n",
      "\n",
      "We can access Llama models using Ollama. Installation is pretty straightforward. You need to download Ollama from [the website](https://ollama.com/download) and then go through the installation process. That’s it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, you can test the model in CLI by running the following command.\n",
      "\n",
      "```wp-block-prismatic-blocks\n",
      "ollama run llama3\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "We will start with a ModelFile ([documentation](https://github.com/ollama/ollama/blob/main/docs/modelfile.md)). I only specified the base model (`llama3`), temperature and stop sequence. However, you might add more features. For example, you can determine the system message using `SYSTEM` keyword.\n",

      "## Use cases: working with documentation\n",
      "\n",
      "As analysts, we often play the role of subject matter experts for data and some data-related tools. In my previous team, we used to have a channel with almost 1K participants, where we were answering lots of questions about our data and the ClickHouse database we used as storage. It took us quite a lot of time to manage this channel. It would be interesting to see whether such tasks can be automated with LLMs.\n",
      "\n",
      "For this example, I will use the ClickHouse database. If you’re interested, You can learn more about ClickHouse and how to set it up locally in [my previous article](https://clickhouse.com/). However, we won’t utilise any ClickHouse-specific features, so feel free to stick to the database you know.\n",
      "\n",
      "I’ve created a pretty simple data model to work with. There are just two tables in our DWH (Data Warehouse): `ecommerce_db.users` and `ecommerce_db.sessions`. As you might guess, the first table contains information about the users of our service.\n",
      "\n",
      "![](https://towardsdatascience.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/1LukeFk5kSyBCOU4bV3yfzg-1.png)\n",
      "\n",
      "The `ecommerce_db.sessions` table stores information about user sessions.\n",
      "\n",
      "![](https://towardsdatascience.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/1WqZwGilme-NwyQtRobomSw-1.png)\n",
      "\n",
      "Regarding data source management, analysts typically handle tasks like writing and updating documentation and answering questions about this data. So, we will use LLM to write documentation for the table in the database and teach it to answer questions about data or ClickHouse.\n",
      "\n",
      "But before moving on to the implementation, let’s learn more about the CrewAI framework and its core concepts.\n",
      "\n",
      "## CrewAI basic concepts\n",
      "\n",
      "The cornerstone of a multi-[agent](https://docs.crewai.com/core-concepts/Agents/) framework is an **agent** concept. In CrewAI, agents are powered by role-playing. Role-playing is a tactic when you ask an agent to adopt a persona and behave like a top-notch backend engineer or helpful customer support agent. So, when creating a CrewAI agent, you need to specify each agent’s role, goal, and backstory so that LLM knows enough to play this role.\n",
      "\n",
      "The agents’ capabilities are limited without **[tools](https://docs.crewai.com/core-concepts/Tools/)** (functions that agents can execute and get results). With CrewAI, you can use one of the predefined tools (for example, to search the Internet, parse a website, or do RAG on a document), create a custom tool yourself or use LangChain tools. So, it’s pretty easy to create a powerful agent.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let’s move on from agents to the work they are doing. Agents are working on **[tasks](https://docs.crewai.com/core-concepts/Tasks/#task-attributes)** (specific assignments). For each task, we need to define a description, expected output (definition of done), set of available tools and assigned agent. I really like that these frameworks follow the managerial best practices like a clear definition of done for the tasks.\n",
      "\n",
      "The next question is how to define the execution order for tasks: which one to work on first, which ones can run in parallel, etc. CrewAI implemented **[processes](https://docs.crewai.com/core-concepts/Processes/)** to orchestrate the tasks. It provides a couple of options:\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Sequential** -the most straightforward approach when tasks are called one after another.\n",
      "* **Hierarchical** – when there’s a manager (specified as LLM model) that creates and delegates tasks to the agents.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, CrewAI is working on a consensual process. In such a process, agents will be able to make decisions collaboratively with a democratic approach.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are other levers you can use to tweak the process of tasks’ execution:\n",
      "\n",
      "* You can mark tasks as \"asynchronous\", then they will be executed in parallel, so you will be able to get an answer faster.\n",
      "* You can use the \"human input\" flag on a task, and then the agent will ask for human approval before finalising the output of this task. It can allow you to add an oversight to the process.\n",
      "\n",
      "We’ve defined all the primary building blocks and can discuss the holly grail of CrewAI – **[crew](https://docs.crewai.com/core-concepts/Crews/#crew-attributes)** concept. The crew represents the team of agents and the set of tasks they will be working on. The approach for collaboration (processes we discussed above) can also be defined at the crew level.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, we can set up the **[memory](https://docs.crewai.com/core-concepts/Memory/)** for a crew. Memory is crucial for efficient collaboration between the agents. CrewAI supports three levels of memory:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Short-term memory stores information related to the current execution. It helps agents to work together on the current task.\n",
      "* Long-term memory is data about the previous executions stored in the local database. This type of memory allows agents to learn from earlier iterations and improve over time.\n",
      "* Entity memory captures and structures information about entities (like personas, cities, etc.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Right now, you can only switch on all types of memory for a crew without any further customisation. However, it doesn’t work with the Llama models.\n",
      "\n",
      "We’ve learned enough about the CrewAI framework, so it’s time to start using this knowledge in practice.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Use case: writing documentation\n",
      "\n",
      "Let’s start with a simple task: putting together the documentation for our DWH. As we discussed before, there are two tables in our DWH, and I would like to create a detailed description for them using LLMs.\n",
      "\n",
      "### First approach\n",
      "\n",
      "In the beginning, we need to think about the team structure. Think of this as a typical managerial task. Who would you hire for such a job?\n",
      "\n",
      "I would break this task into two parts: retrieving data from a database and writing documentation. So, we need a database specialist and a technical writer. The database specialist needs access to a database, while the writer won’t need any special tools.\n",
      "\n",
      "![](https://towardsdatascience.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/10YLuYhwdFr0hKuS46qjEfA-1.png)\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, we have a high-level plan. Let’s create the agents.\n",
      "\n",
      "For each agent, I’ve specified the role, goal and backstory. I’ve tried my best to provide agents with all the needed context.\n",
      "\n",
      "```wp-block-prismatic-blocks\n",
      "database_specialist_agent = Agent(\n",
      "  role = \"Database specialist\",\n",
      "  goal = \"Provide data to answer business questions using SQL\",\n",
      "  backstory = '''You are an expert in SQL, so you can help the team \n",
      "  to gather needed data to power their decisions. \n",
      "  You are very accurate and take into account all the nuances in data.''',\n",
      "  allow_delegation = False,\n",
      "  verbose = True\n",
      ")\n",
      "\n",
      "tech_writer_agent = Agent(\n",
      "  role = \"Technical writer\",\n",
      "  goal = '''Write engaging and factually accurate technical documentation \n",
      "    for data sources or tools''',\n",
      "  backstory = ''' \n",
      "  You are an expert in both technology and communications, so you can easily explain even sophisticated concepts.\n",
      "  You base your work on the factual information provided by your colleagues.\n",
      "  Your texts are concise and can be easily understood by a wide audience. \n",
      "  You use professional but rather an informal style in your communication.\n",
      "  ''',\n",
      "  allow_delegation = False,\n",
      "  verbose = True\n",
      ")\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "We will use a simple sequential process, so there’s no need for agents to delegate tasks to each other. That’s why I specified `allow_delegation = False`.\n",
      "\n",
      "The next step is setting the tasks for agents. But before moving to them, we need to create a custom tool to connect to the database.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, I put together a function to execute ClickHouse queries using HTTP API.\n",
      "\n",
      "```wp-block-prismatic-blocks\n",
      "CH_HOST = 'http://localhost:8123' # default address \n",
      "\n",
      "def get_clickhouse_data(query, host = CH_HOST, connection_timeout = 1500):\n",
      "  r = requests.post(host, params = {'query': query}, \n",
      "    timeout = connection_timeout)\n",
      "  if r.status_code == 200:\n",
      "      return r.text\n",
      "  else: \n",
      "      return 'Database returned the following error:n' + r.text\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "When working with LLM agents, it’s important to make tools fault-tolerant. For example, if the database returns an error (`status_code != 200`), my code won’t throw an exception. Instead, it will return the error description to the LLM so it can attempt to resolve the issue.\n",
      "\n",
      "To create a CrewAI custom tool, we need to derive our class from `crewai_tools.BaseTool`, implement the `_run` method and then create an instance of this class.\n",
      "\n",
      "```wp-block-prismatic-blocks\n",
      "from crewai_tools import BaseTool\n",
      "\n",
      "class DatabaseQuery(BaseTool):\n",
      "  name: str = \"Database Query\"\n",
      "  description: str = \"Returns the result of SQL query execution\"\n",
      "\n",
      "  def _run(self, sql_query: str) -> str:\n",
      "      # Implementation goes here\n",
      "      return get_clickhouse_data(sql_query)\n",
      "\n",
      "database_query_tool = DatabaseQuery()\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, we can set the tasks for the agents. Again, providing clear instructions and all the context to LLM is crucial.\n",

      "\n",
      "Accuracy is often critical for LLM applications, especially in cases such as API calling or summarisation of financial reports. Fortunately, there are ways to enhance precision. The best practices to improve accuracy include the following steps:\n",
      "\n",
      "* You can start simply with **prompt engineering techniques** – adding more detailed instructions, using few-shot prompting, or asking the model to think step-by-step.\n",
      "* If accuracy is still insufficient, you can incorporate a **self-reflection step**, for example, to return errors from the API calls and ask the LLM to correct mistakes.\n",
      "* The next option is to provide the most relevant context to the LLM using **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** to boost precision further.\n",
      "\n",
      "We’ve explored this approach in my previous TDS article, *[\"From Prototype to Production: Enhancing LLM Accuracy\"](https://medium.com/towards-data-science/from-prototype-to-production-enhancing-llm-accuracy-791d79b0af9b).* In that project, we built an SQL Agent and went from 0% valid SQL queries to 70% accuracy. However, there are limits to what we can achieve with prompt. To break through this barrier and reach the next frontier of accuracy, we need to adopt more advanced techniques.\n",
      "\n",
      "The most promising option is fine-tuning. With fine-tuning, we can move from relying solely on information in prompts to embedding additional information directly into the model’s weights.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Fine-tuning\n",
      "\n",
      "Let’s start by understanding what fine-tuning is. Fine-tuning is the process of refining pre-trained models by training them on smaller, task-specific datasets to enhance their performance in particular applications. Basic models are initially trained on vast amounts of data, which allows them to develop a broad understanding of language. Fine-tuning, however, tailors these models to specialized tasks, transforming them from general-purpose systems into highly targeted tools. For example, instruction fine-tuning taught GPT-2 to chat and follow instructions, and that’s how ChatGPT emerged.\n",
      "\n",
      "Basic LLMs are initially trained to predict the next token based on vast text corpora. Fine-tuning typically adopts a supervised approach, where the model is presented with specific questions and corresponding answers, allowing it to adjust its weights to improve accuracy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Historically, fine-tuning required updating all model weights, a method known as full fine-tuning. This process was computationally expensive since it required storing all the model weights, states, gradients and forward activations in memory. To address these challenges, parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques were introduced. PEFT methods update only the small set of the model parameters while keeping the rest frozen. Among these methods, one of the most widely adopted is [LoRA](https://github.com/microsoft/LoRA) (Low-Rank Adaptation), which significantly reduces the computational cost without compromising performance.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Pros & cons\n",
      "\n",
      "Before considering fine-tuning, it’s essential to weigh its advantages and limitations.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Advantages:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* Fine-tuning enables the model to learn and retain significantly more information than can be provided through prompts alone.\n",
      "* It usually gives higher accuracy, often exceeding 90%.\n",
      "* During inference, it can reduce costs by enabling the use of smaller, task-specific models instead of larger, general-purpose ones.\n",
      "* Fine-tuned small models can often be deployed on-premises, eliminating reliance on cloud providers such as OpenAI or Anthropic. This approach reduces costs, enhances privacy, and minimizes dependency on external infrastructure.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Disadvantages:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* Fine-tuning requires upfront investments for model training and data preparation.\n",
      "* It requires specific technical knowledge and may involve a steep learning curve.\n",
      "* The quality of results depends heavily on the availability of high-quality training data.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since this project is focused on gaining knowledge, we will proceed with fine-tuning. However, in real-world scenarios, it’s important to evaluate whether the benefits of fine-tuning justify all the associated costs and efforts.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Execution\n",
      "\n",
      "The next step is to plan how we will approach fine-tuning. After listening to the [\"Improving Accuracy of LLM Applications\"](https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/improving-accuracy-of-llm-applications/) course, I’ve decided to try [the Lamini platform](https://www.lamini.ai/) for the following reasons:\n",
      "\n",
      "* It offers a simple one-line API call to fine-tune the model. It’s especially convenient since we’re just starting to learn a new technique.\n",
      "* Although it’s not free and can be quite expensive for toy projects (at $1 per tuning step), they offer free credits upon registration, which are sufficient for initial testing.\n",
      "* Lamini has implemented a new approach, Lamini Memory Tuning, which promises zero loss of factual accuracy while preserving general capabilities. This is a significant claim, and it’s worth testing out. We will discuss this approach in more detail shortly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course, there are lots of other fine-tuning options you can consider:\n",
      "\n",

      "### Lamini Memory Tuning\n",
      "\n",
      "As I mentioned earlier, Lamini released a new approach to fine-tuning, and I believe it’s worth discussing it in more detail.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lamini introduced the Mixture of Memory Experts (MoME) approach, which enables LLMs to learn a vast amount of factual information with almost zero loss, all while maintaining generalization capabilities and requiring a feasible amount of computational resources.\n",
      "\n",
      "To achieve this, Lamini extended a pre-trained LLM by adding a large number (on the order of 1 million) of LoRA adapters along with a cross-attention layer. Each LoRA adapter is a memory expert, functioning as a type of memory for the model. These memory experts specialize in different aspects, ensuring that the model retains faithful and accurate information from the data it was tuned on. Inspired by information retrieval, these million memory experts are equivalent to indices from which the model intelligently retrieves and routes.\n",
      "\n",
      "At inference time, the model retrieves a subset of the most relevant experts at each layer and merges back into the base model to generate a response to the user query.\n",

      "Lamini Memory Tuning is [said](https://www.lamini.ai/blog/lamini-memory-tuning) to be capable of achieving 95% accuracy. The key difference from traditional instruction fine-tuning is that instead of optimizing for average error across all tasks, this approach focuses on achieving zero error for the facts the model is specifically trained to remember.\n",

      "Lamini Memory Tuning holds great promise – let’s see if it delivers on its potential in practice.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Setup\n",
      "\n",
      "As always, let’s begin by setting everything up. As we discussed, we’ll be using [Lamini](https://docs.lamini.ai/) to fine-tune Llama, so the first step is to install the Lamini package.\n",
      "\n",
      "```wp-block-prismatic-blocks\n",
      "pip install lamini\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, we need to set up the Lamini API Key on [their website](https://app.lamini.ai/account) and specify it as an environment variable.\n",
      "\n",
      "```wp-block-prismatic-blocks\n",

      "As I mentioned above, we will be improving the SQL Agent, so we need a database. For this example, we’ll continue using ClickHouse, but feel free to choose any database that suits your needs.

      "## Creating a training dataset\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "The key factors to consider while preparing the dataset:\n",
      "\n",
      "* **The quality of the data** is crucial, as we will ask the model to remember these facts.\n",
      "* **Diversity** in the examples is important so that a model can learn how to handle different cases.\n",
      "* It’s preferable to use **real data** rather than synthetically generated data since it better represents real-life questions.\n",
      "* The usual minimum size for a fine-tuning dataset is around **1,000 examples**, but the more high-quality data, the better.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Generating examples\n",
      "\n",
      "All the information required to create question-and-answer pairs is present in the database schema, so it will be a feasible task for an LLM to generate examples. Additionally, I have a [representative set](https://github.com/miptgirl/miptgirl_medium/blob/main/sql_agent_accuracy/rag_set.json) of Q&A pairs that I used for RAG approach, which we can present to the LLM as examples of valid queries (using the few-shot prompting technique). Let’s load the RAG dataset.\n",

      "Evaluation is the cornerstone of any machine learning product. Investing in quality measurement delivers significant returns. Let’s explore the potential business benefits.\n",
      "\n",
      "* As management consultant and writer Peter Drucker once said, *“If you can’t measure it, you can’t improve it.”* Building a robust evaluation system helps you identify areas for improvement and take meaningful actions to enhance your product.\n",
      "* LLM evaluations are like testing in software engineering — they allow you to iterate faster and more safely by ensuring a baseline level of quality.\n",
      "* A solid quality framework is especially crucial in highly regulated industries. If you’re implementing AI or LLMs in areas like fintech or healthcare, you’ll likely need to demonstrate that your system works reliably and is continuously monitored over time.\n",
      "* By consistently investing in LLM evaluations and developing a comprehensive set of questions and answers, you may eventually be able to replace a large, expensive LLM with a smaller model fine-tuned to your specific use case. That could lead to significant cost savings.\n",
      "\n",
      "As we’ve seen, a solid quality framework can bring significant value to a business. In this article, I will walk you through the end-to-end process of building an evaluation system for LLM products — from assessing early prototypes to implementing continuous quality monitoring in production.\n",
      "\n",
      "This article will focus on high-level approaches and best practices, but we’ll also touch on specific implementation details. For the hands-on part, I will be using [Evidently](https://www.evidentlyai.com/), an open-source library that offers a comprehensive testing stack for AI products, ranging from classic machine learning to LLMs.\n",
      "\n",
      "I chose to explore the Evidently framework after finishing their well-structured open-source [course on LLM evaluation](https://www.evidentlyai.com/llm-evaluations-course). However, you can implement a similar evaluation system using other tools. There are several great open-source alternatives worth considering. Here are just a few:\n",

      "\n",
      "This article will focus on best practices and the overall evaluation process, so feel free to choose whichever framework best suits your needs.\n",

      "\n",
      "* We will start by introducing the **use case** we will be focusing on: a SQL agent.\n",
      "* Then, we will quickly build a **rough prototype** of the agent — just enough to have something we can evaluate.\n",
      "* Next, we will cover **the evaluation approach during the experimentation phase**: how to collect an evaluation dataset, define useful metrics, and assess the model’s quality.\n",
      "* Finally, we’ll explore **how to monitor the quality of your LLM product post-launch**, highlighting the importance of observability and the additional metrics you can track once the feature is live in production.\n",
      "\n",
      "## The first prototype\n",
      "\n",
      "It’s often easier to discuss a topic when we focus on a specific example, so let’s consider one product. Imagine we’re working on an analytical system that helps our customers track key metrics for their e-commerce businesses — things like the number of customers, revenue, fraud rates, and so on.\n",
      "\n",
      "Through customer research, we learned that a significant portion of our users struggle to interpret our reports. They would much prefer the option to interact with an assistant and get immediate, clear answers to their questions. Therefore, we decided to build an LLM-powered agent that can respond to customer queries about their data.\n",

      "I’ve built an MVP version of the agent, but there’s plenty of room for improvement. For example:\n",
      "\n",
      "* One possible improvement is converting it into a **Multi-AI agent system**, with distinct roles such as a triage agent (which classifies the initial question), an SQL expert, and a final editor (who assembles the customer’s answer according to the guidelines). If you’re interested in building such a system, you can find a detailed guide for LangGraph in [my previous article](https://towardsdatascience.com/from-basics-to-advanced-exploring-langgraph-e8c1cf4db787/).\n",
      "* Another improvement is adding **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**, where we provide relevant examples based on embeddings. In [my previous attempt](https://towardsdatascience.com/from-prototype-to-production-enhancing-llm-accuracy-791d79b0af9b/) at building an SQL agent, RAG helped boost accuracy from 10% to 60%.\n",
      "* Another enhancement is introducing a **human-in-the-loop** approach, where the system can ask customers for feedback.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this article, we will concentrate on developing the evaluation framework, so it’s perfectly fine that our initial version isn’t fully optimised yet.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Prototype: evaluating quality\n",
      "\n",
      "### Gathering evaluation dataset\n",
      "\n",
      "Now that we have our first MVP, we can start focusing on its quality. Any evaluation begins with data, and the first step is to gather a set of questions — and ideally answers — so we have something to measure against.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let’s discuss how we can gather the set of questions:\n",
      "\n",
      "* I recommend starting by **creating a small dataset of questions yourself** and manually testing your product with them. This will give you a better understanding of the actual quality of your solution and help you determine the best way to assess it. Once you have that insight, you can scale the solution effectively.\n",
      "* Another option is to **leverage historical data**. For instance, we may already have a channel where CS agents answer customer questions about our reports. These question-and-answer pairs can be valuable for evaluating our LLM product.\n",
      "* We can also use **synthetic data**. LLMs can generate plausible questions and question-and-answer pairs. For example, in our case, we could expand our initial manual set by asking the LLM to provide similar examples or rephrase existing questions. Alternatively, we could use an RAG approach, where we provide the LLM with parts of our documentation and ask it to generate questions and answers based on that content.\n",
      "\n",
      "> ***Tip**: Using a more powerful model to generate data for evaluation can be beneficial. Creating a golden dataset is a one-time investment that pays off by enabling more reliable and accurate quality assessments.*\n",
      "\n",
      "* Once we have a more mature version, we can potentially share it with a group of beta testers to gather their feedback.\n",
      "\n",
      "When creating your evaluation set, it’s important to include a diverse range of examples. Make sure to cover:\n",
      "\n",
      "* **A representative sample of real user questions** about your product to reflect typical usage.\n",
      "* **Edge cases**, such as very long questions, queries in different languages, or incomplete questions. It’s also crucial to define the expected behaviour in these scenarios — for instance, should the system respond in English if the question is asked in French?\n",
      "* **Adversarial inputs**, like off-topic questions or jailbreak attempts (where users try to manipulate the model into producing inappropriate responses or exposing sensitive information).\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, let’s apply these approaches in practice. Following my own advice, I manually created a small evaluation dataset with 10 questions and corresponding ground truth answers. I then ran our MVP agent on the same questions to collect its responses for comparison.\n",

      "Article Title: The Future of AI Agent Communication with ACP\n",
      "\n",
      "Article Content (excerpt):\n",
      "It’s exciting to see the GenAI industry beginning to move toward standardisation. We might be witnessing something similar to the early days of the internet, when HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) first emerged. When Tim Berners-Lee developed HTTP in 1990, it provided a simple yet extensible protocol that transformed the internet from a specialised research network into the globally accessible World Wide Web. By 1993, web browsers like Mosaic had made HTTP so popular that web traffic quickly outpaced other systems.\n",
      "\n",
      "One promising step in this direction is MCP (Model Context Protocol), developed by Anthropic. MCP is gaining popularity with its attempts to standardise the interactions between LLMs and external tools or data sources. More recently ([*the first commit*](https://github.com/i-am-bee/acp/commit/19e4c708153e23b529d09cdc6e23f0e95ef8a933) *is dated April 2025*), a new protocol called ACP (Agent Communication Protocol) appeared. It complements MCP by defining the ways in which agents can communicate with each other.\n",

      "\n",
      "Example of architecure | Image by author\n",
      "\n",
      "In this article, I would like to discuss what ACP is, why it can be helpful and how it can be used in practice. We will build a multi-agent AI system for interacting with data.\n",
      "\n",
      "## ACP overview\n",
      "\n",
      "Before jumping into practice, let’s take a moment to understand the theory behind ACP and how it works under the hood.\n",
      "\n",
      "ACP (Agent Communication Protocol) is an open protocol designed to address the growing challenge of connecting AI agents, applications, and humans. The current GenAI industry is quite fragmented, with different teams building agents in isolation using various, often incompatible frameworks and technologies. This fragmentation slows down innovation and makes it difficult for agents to collaborate effectively.\n",
      "\n",
      "To address this challenge, ACP aims to standardise communication between agents via RESTful APIs. The protocol is framework- and technology-agnostic, meaning it can be used with any agentic framework, such as LangChain, CrewAI, smolagents, or others. This flexibility makes it easier to build interoperable systems where agents can seamlessly work together, regardless of how they were originally developed.\n",
      "\n",
      "This protocol has been developed as an open standard under the Linux Foundation, alongside BeeAI (its reference implementation). One of the key points the team emphasises is that ACP is openly governed and shaped by the community, rather than a group of vendors.\n",
      "\n",
      "What benefits can ACP bring?\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Easily replaceable agents.** With the current pace of innovation in the GenAI space, new cutting-edge technologies are emerging all the time. ACP enables agents to be swapped in production seamlessly, reducing maintenance costs and making it easier to adopt the most advanced tools when they become available.\n",
      "* **Enabling collaboration between multiple agents** **built on different frameworks.** As we know from people management, specialisation often leads to better results. The same applies to agentic systems. The group of agents, each focused on a specific task (like writing Python code or researching the web), can often outperform a single agent trying to do everything. ACP makes it possible for such specialised agents to communicate and work together, even if they are built using different frameworks or technologies.\n",
      "* **New opportunities for partnerships.** With a unified standard for agents’ communication, it would be easier for agents to collaborate, sparking new partnerships between different teams within the company or even different companies. Imagine a world where your smart home agent notices the temperature dropping unusually, determines that the heating system has failed, and checks with your utility provider’s agent to confirm there are no planned outages. Finally, it books a technician coordinating the visit with your Google Calendar agent to make sure you’re home. It may sound futuristic, but with ACP, it can be pretty close.\n",
      "\n",
      "We’ve covered what ACP is and why it matters. The protocol looks quite promising. So, let’s put it to the test and see how it works in practice.\n",
      "\n",
      "## ACP in practice\n",
      "\n",
      "Let’s try ACP in a classic “talk to data” use case. To use the benefit of ACP being framework agnostic, we will build ACP agents with different frameworks:\n",
      "\n",
      "* **SQL Agent** with CrewAI to compose SQL queries\n",
      "* **DB Agent** with HuggingFace smolagents to execute those queries.\n",
      "\n",
      "> *I won’t go into the details of each framework here, but if you’re curious, I’ve written in-depth articles on both of them:   \n",

      "\n",
      "### Building DB Agent\n",
      "\n",
      "Let’s start with the DB agent. As I mentioned earlier, ACP could be complemented by MCP. So, I will use tools from my analytics toolbox through the MCP server.

      "   - uniqExactIf() for conditional unique counts\n",
      "   - quantile() functions for percentiles\n",
      "   - Date functions: toStartOfMonth(), toStartOfYear(), today()\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Query formatting requirements:**\n",
      "   - Always end queries with \"format TabSeparatedWithNames\"\n",
      "   - Use meaningful column aliases\n",
      "   - Use proper JOIN syntax when combining tables\n",
      "   - Wrap date literals in quotes (e.g., '2024-01-01')\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Performance considerations:**\n",
      "   - Use appropriate WHERE clauses to filter data\n",
      "   - Consider using HAVING for post-aggregation filtering\n",
      "   - Use LIMIT when finding top/bottom results\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Data interpretation:**\n",
      "   - revenue > 0 indicates a purchase session\n",
      "   - revenue = 0 indicates a browsing session without purchase\n",
      "   - is_fraud = 1 sessions should typically be excluded from business metrics unless specifically analyzing fraud\n",

      "Article Title: From Prototype to Production: Enhancing LLM Accuracy\n",
      "\n",
      "Article Content (excerpt):\n",
      "Building a prototype for an LLM application is surprisingly straightforward. You can often create a functional first version within just a few hours. This initial prototype will likely provide results that look legitimate and be a good tool to demonstrate your approach. However, this is usually not enough for production use.\n",
      "\n",
      "LLMs are probabilistic by nature, as they generate tokens based on the distribution of likely continuations. This means that in many cases, we get the answer close to the \"correct\" one from the distribution. Sometimes, this is acceptable – for example, it doesn’t matter whether the app says \"Hello, John!\" or \"Hi, John!\". In other cases, the difference is critical, such as between \"The revenue in 2024 was 20M USD\" and \"The revenue in 2024 was 20M GBP\".\n",
      "\n",
      "In many real-world business scenarios, precision is crucial, and \"almost right\" isn’t good enough. For example, when your LLM application needs to execute API calls, or you’re doing a summary of financial reports. From my experience, ensuring the accuracy and consistency of results is far more complex and time-consuming than building the initial prototype.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this article, I will discuss how to approach measuring and improving accuracy. We’ll build an SQL Agent where precision is vital for ensuring that queries are executable. Starting with a basic prototype, we’ll explore methods to measure accuracy and test various techniques to enhance it, such as self-reflection and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).\n",
      "\n",
      "## Setup\n",
      "\n",
      "As usual, let’s begin with the setup. The core components of our SQL agent solution are the LLM model, which generates queries, and the SQL database, which executes them.\n",
      "\n",
      "### LLM model – Llama\n",
      "\n",
      "For this project, we will use an open-source Llama model released by Meta. I’ve chosen [Llama 3.1 8B](https://ollama.com/library/llama3.1:8b) because it is lightweight enough to run on my laptop while still being quite powerful (refer to the [documentation](https://ai.meta.com/blog/meta-llama-3-1/) for details).\n",
      "\n",
      "If you haven’t installed it yet, you can find guides [here](https://www.llama.com/docs/llama-everywhere). I use it locally on MacOS via [Ollama](https://ollama.com/). Using the following command, we can download the model.\n",

      "ollama pull llama3.1:8b\n",

      "\n",
      "As discussed, our goal is to build an SQL Agent – an application that generates SQL queries to answer customer questions. In the future, we can add another layer to this system: executing the SQL query, passing both the initial question and the database results back to the LLM, and asking it to generate a human-friendly answer. However, for this article, we’ll focus on the first step.\n",

This system will be a cornerstone for performance improvement iterations. Without it, we’d essentially be navigating in the dark.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Evaluating the accuracy\n",
      "\n",
      "### Evaluation basics\n",
      "\n",
      "To ensure we’re improving, we need a robust way to measure accuracy. The most common approach is to create a \"golden\" evaluation set with questions and correct answers. Then, we can compare the model’s output with these \"golden\" answers and calculate the share of correct ones. While this approach sounds simple, there are a few nuances worth discussing.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, you might feel overwhelmed at the thought of creating a comprehensive set of questions and answers. Building such a dataset can seem like a daunting task, potentially requiring weeks or months. However, we can start small by creating an initial set of 20–50 examples and iterating on it.\n",
      "\n",
      "As always, quality is more important than quantity. Our goal is to create a representative and diverse dataset. Ideally, this should include:\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Common questions.** In most real-life cases, we can take the history of actual questions and use it as our initial evaluation set.\n",
      "* **Challenging edge cases.** It’s worth adding examples where the model tends to hallucinate. You can find such cases either while experimenting yourself or by gathering feedback from the first prototype.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once the dataset is ready, the next challenge is how to score the generated results. We can consider several approaches:\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Comparing SQL queries.** The first idea is to compare the generated SQL query with the one in the evaluation set. However, it might be tricky. Similarly-looking queries can yield completely different results. At the same time, queries that look different can lead to the same conclusions. Additionally, simply comparing SQL queries doesn’t verify whether the generated query is actually executable. Given these challenges, I wouldn’t consider this approach the most reliable solution for our case.\n",
      "* **Exact matches.** We can use old-school exact matching when answers in our evaluation set are deterministic. For example, if the question is, \"How many customers are there?\" and the answer is \"592800\", the model’s response must match precisely. However, this approach has its limitations. Consider the example above, and the model responds, *\"There are 592,800 customers\"*. While the answer is absolutely correct, an exact match approach would flag it as invalid.\n",
      "* **Using LLMs for scoring.** A more robust and flexible approach is to leverage LLMs for evaluation. Instead of focusing on query structure, we can ask the LLM to compare the results of SQL executions. This method is particularly effective in cases where the query might differ but still yields correct outputs.\n",
      "\n",
      "It’s worth keeping in mind that evaluation isn’t a one-time task; it’s a continuous process. To push our model’s performance further, we need to expand the dataset with examples causing the model’s hallucinations. In production mode, we can create a feedback loop. By gathering input from users, we can identify cases where the model fails and\n",

      "--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "# Key AI Trends and Concepts from the Article\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on this 2025 article, here are the main AI trends and concepts discussed:\n",
      "\n",
      "## 1. **Agentic AI and Reflection Design Pattern**\n",
      "The core focus is on **reflection** as a fundamental agentic design pattern where LLMs iteratively review and improve their outputs through feedback loops, mimicking human work processes. This enables AI agents to self-critique and refine results rather than generating responses in a single pass.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 2. **Building AI Systems from First Principles**\n",
      "A trend toward understanding AI tools \"from scratch\" rather than relying solely on high-level frameworks. The article advocates working directly with foundation model APIs to gain deeper understanding of how agentic systems actually work.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 3. **Self-Correction and Iterative Refinement Techniques**\n",
      "Key methodologies cited include:\n",
      "- **Self-Refine** (self-feedback loops)\n",
      "- **Reflexion** (verbal reinforcement learning)\n",
      "- **CRITIC** (tool-interactive critiquing with external feedback)\n",
      "- **ReAct** (combining reasoning and acting)\n",
      "\n",
      "These approaches show 10-30% performance improvements across diverse tasks.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 4. **Popular Agentic AI Frameworks**\n",
      "Mentioned tools and frameworks include: GitHub Copilot, Claude Desktop, OpenAI Operator, Perplexity Comet, CrewAI, smolagents, DSPy, and LangGraph.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 5. **Production Trade-offs: Quality vs. Cost/Latency**\n",
      "Recognition that reflection's quality improvements must be balanced against increased API calls, latency, and costs—a key consideration for real-world business applications.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Beyond Prompting: The Power of Context Engineering\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "# Key AI Trends and Concepts from the Article\n",
      "\n",
      "## 1. **Context Engineering as a Discipline**\n",
      "A systematic approach to optimizing what information goes into an LLM's prompt, positioning itself as a cost-effective alternative to fine-tuning. Focuses on making \"self-improving\" systems that learn from experience without retraining model parameters.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 2. **Evolution from Static to Self-Improving Contexts**\n",
      "Progression through three stages:\n",
      "- **Static prompting** (hand-crafted, fixed instructions)\n",
      "- **Dynamic retrieval** (RAG - Retrieval-Augmented Generation)\n",
      "- **Self-improving contexts** (adaptive systems that update based on past performance)\n",
      "\n",
      "## 3. **Agentic Context Engineering (ACE) Framework**\n",
      "A novel 2025 approach that addresses \"brevity bias\" and \"context collapse\" through:\n",
      "- Structured \"playbook\" of reusable knowledge bullets with metadata\n",
      "- Three-component loop: Generator → Reflector → Curator\n",
      "- Incremental delta updates rather than full prompt rewrites\n",
      "- 83.6% lower token costs with +10.6% performance improvement on benchmarks\n",
      "\n",
      "## 4. **Natural Language-Based Learning Methods**\n",
      "Emergence of frameworks using verbal/textual feedback instead of gradient-based updates:\n",
      "- **Reflexion** - learning through natural language reflection\n",
      "- **TextGrad** - \"backpropagation\" using textual critiques\n",
      "- **GEPA** - evolutionary algorithms with prompt mutation and selection\n",
      "\n",
      "## 5. **Test-Time Learning and Adaptive Memory**\n",
      "Systems that accumulate and reuse knowledge during inference without explicit retraining, enabling continuous improvement through persistent memory mechanisms.\n",
      "\n",

      "## 1. **LLM Agents and Agentic AI**\n",
      "The article introduces **LLM agents** as a paradigm shift from predefined workflows to autonomous reasoning systems. Instead of hardcoding every step, agents use LLMs as a \"reasoning engine\" to dynamically choose actions and determine when to return final answers—mirroring how human analysts work.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 2. **Tool-Using LLMs (Function Calling)**\n",
      "The article focuses on **OpenAI function calling** as a critical capability that allows LLMs to interact with external systems. This enables LLMs to invoke tools like SQL executors, calculators, or search engines, bridging the gap between language models and real-world data systems.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 3. **Structured Output via Function Calling**\n",
      "Two key use cases for functions are highlighted:\n",
      "- **Tagging & Extraction**: Using function calls to ensure structured, validated output formats instead of unstructured text\n",
      "- **Tools & Routing**: Enabling agent-like behavior where LLMs can select and execute appropriate tools\n",

      "--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "# Key AI Trends and Concepts from the Article\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on this 2025 article, here are the main AI trends and concepts discussed:\n",
      "\n",
      "## 1. **Agentic AI and Reflection Design Pattern**\n",
      "The core focus is on **reflection** as a fundamental agentic design pattern where LLMs iteratively review and improve their outputs through feedback loops, mimicking human work processes. This enables AI agents to self-critique and refine results rather than generating responses in a single pass.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 2. **Building AI Systems from First Principles**\n",
      "A trend toward understanding AI tools \"from scratch\" rather than relying solely on high-level frameworks. The article advocates working directly with foundation model APIs to gain deeper understanding of how agentic systems actually work.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 3. **Self-Correction and Iterative Refinement Techniques**\n",
      "Key methodologies cited include:\n",
      "- **Self-Refine** (self-feedback loops)\n",
      "- **Reflexion** (verbal reinforcement learning)\n",
      "- **CRITIC** (tool-interactive critiquing with external feedback)\n",
      "- **ReAct** (combining reasoning and acting)\n",
      "\n",
      "These approaches show 10-30% performance improvements across diverse tasks.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 4. **Popular Agentic AI Frameworks**\n",
      "Mentioned tools and frameworks include: GitHub Copilot, Claude Desktop, OpenAI Operator, Perplexity Comet, CrewAI, smolagents, DSPy, and LangGraph.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 5. **Production Trade-offs: Quality vs. Cost/Latency**\n",
      "Recognition that reflection's quality improvements must be balanced against increased API calls, latency, and costs—a key consideration for real-world business applications.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Beyond Prompting: The Power of Context Engineering\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "# Key AI Trends and Concepts from the Article\n",
      "\n",
      "## 1. **Context Engineering as a Discipline**\n",
      "A systematic approach to optimizing what information goes into an LLM's prompt, positioning itself as a cost-effective alternative to fine-tuning. Focuses on making \"self-improving\" systems that learn from experience without retraining model parameters.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 2. **Evolution from Static to Self-Improving Contexts**\n",
      "Progression through three stages:\n",
      "- **Static prompting** (hand-crafted, fixed instructions)\n",
      "- **Dynamic retrieval** (RAG - Retrieval-Augmented Generation)\n",
      "- **Self-improving contexts** (adaptive systems that update based on past performance)\n",
      "\n",
      "## 3. **Agentic Context Engineering (ACE) Framework**\n",
      "A novel 2025 approach that addresses \"brevity bias\" and \"context collapse\" through:\n",
      "- Structured \"playbook\" of reusable knowledge bullets with metadata\n",
      "- Three-component loop: Generator → Reflector → Curator\n",
      "- Incremental delta updates rather than full prompt rewrites\n",
      "- 83.6% lower token costs with +10.6% performance improvement on benchmarks\n",
      "\n",
      "## 4. **Natural Language-Based Learning Methods**\n",
      "Emergence of frameworks using verbal/textual feedback instead of gradient-based updates:\n",
      "- **Reflexion** - learning through natural language reflection\n",
      "- **TextGrad** - \"backpropagation\" using textual critiques\n",
      "- **GEPA** - evolutionary algorithms with prompt mutation and selection\n",
      "\n",
      "## 5. **Test-Time Learning and Adaptive Memory**\n",
      "Systems that accumulate and reuse knowledge during inference without explicit retraining, enabling continuous improvement through persistent memory mechanisms.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Can LLMs Replace Data Analysts? Building An LLM-Powered Analyst\n",

      "\n",
      "## 1. **LLM Agents and Agentic AI**\n",
      "The article introduces **LLM agents** as a paradigm shift from predefined workflows to autonomous reasoning systems. Instead of hardcoding every step, agents use LLMs as a \"reasoning engine\" to dynamically choose actions and determine when to return final answers—mirroring how human analysts work.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 2. **Tool-Using LLMs (Function Calling)**\n",
      "The article focuses on **OpenAI function calling** as a critical capability that allows LLMs to interact with external systems. This enables LLMs to invoke tools like SQL executors, calculators, or search engines, bridging the gap between language models and real-world data systems.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 3. **Structured Output via Function Calling**\n",
      "Two key use cases for functions are highlighted:\n",
      "- **Tagging & Extraction**: Using function calls to ensure structured, validated output formats instead of unstructured text\n",
      "- **Tools & Routing**: Enabling agent-like behavior where LLMs can select and execute appropriate tools\n",

      "In [the previous article](https://towardsdatascience.com/topic-modelling-using-chatgpt-api-8775b0891d16), we discussed how to do Topic Modelling using ChatGPT and got excellent results. The task was to look at customer reviews for hotel chains and define the main topics mentioned in the reviews.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the previous iteration, we used standard [ChatGPT completions API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/gpt/chat-completions-api) and sent raw prompts ourselves. Such an approach works well when we are doing some ad-hoc analytical research.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, if your team is actively using and monitoring customer reviews, it’s worth considering some automatisation. A good automatisation will not only help you build an autonomous pipeline, but it will also be more convenient (even team members unfamiliar with LLMs and coding will be able to access this data) and more cost-effective (you will send all texts to LLM and pay only once).\n",
      "\n",
      "Suppose we are building a sustainable production-ready service. In that case, it’s worth leveraging existing frameworks to reduce the amount of glue code and have a more modular solution (so that we could easily switch, for example, from one LLM to another).\n",
      "\n",
      "In this article, I would like to tell you about one of the most popular frameworks for LLM applications – [LangChain](https://www.langchain.com). Also, we will understand in detail how to evaluate your model’s performance since it’s a crucial step for business applications.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Nuances of production process\n",
      "\n",
      "### Revising initial approach\n",
      "\n",
      "First, let’s revise our previous approach for ad-hoc Topic Modelling with ChatGPT.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Step 1: Get a representative sample.**\n",
      "\n",
      "We want to determine the list of topics we will use for our markup. The most straightforward way is to send all reviews and ask LLM to define the list of 20–30 topics mentioned in our reviews. Unfortunately, we won’t be able to do it since it won’t fit the context size. We could use a map-reduce approach, but it could be costly. That’s why we would like to define a representative sample.\n",
      "\n",
      "For this, we [built](https://towardsdatascience.com/topic-modelling-using-chatgpt-api-8775b0891d16) a [BERTopic](https://maartengr.github.io/BERTopic/getting_started/quickstart/quickstart.html) topic model and got the most representative reviews for each topic.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Step 2: Determine the list of topics we will use for markup.**\n",
      "\n",
      "The next step is to pass all the selected texts to ChatGPT and ask it to define a list of topics mentioned in these reviews. Then, we can use these topics for later markup.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Step 3: Doing topics’ markup in batches.**\n",
      "\n",
      "The last step is the most straightforward – we can send customer reviews in batches that fit the context size and ask LLM to return topics for each customer review.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, with these three steps, we could determine the list of relevant topics for our texts and classify them all.\n",
      "\n",
      "It works perfectly for one-time research. However, we are missing some bits for an excellent production-ready solution.\n",
      "\n",
      "### From ad-hoc to production\n",
      "\n",
      "Let’s discuss what improvements we could make to our initial ad-hoc approach.\n",
      "\n",
      "* In the previous approach, we have a static list of topics. But in real-life examples, new topics might arise over time, for example, if you launch a new feature. So, we need a feedback loop to update the list of topics we are using. The easiest way to do it is to capture the list of reviews without any assigned topics and regularly run topic modelling on them.\n",
      "* If we are doing one-time research, we can validate the results of the topics’ assignments manually. But for the process that is running in production, we need to think about a continuous evaluation.\n",
      "* If we are building a pipeline for customer review analysis, we should consider more potential use cases and store other related information we might need. For example, it’s helpful to store translated versions of customer reviews so that our colleagues don’t have to use Google Translate all the time. Also, sentiment and other features (for example, products mentioned in the customer review) might be valuable for analysis and filtering.\n",
      "* The LLM industry is progressing quite quickly right now, and everything is changing all the time. It’s worth considering a modular approach where we can quickly iterate and try new approaches over time without rewriting the whole service from scratch.\n",
      "\n",
      "![Scheme of the service by author](https://towardsdatascience.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1ejZtJuZ2xxJpZFjbRPsi8g.jpeg)\n",
      "\n",
      "Scheme of the service by author\n",
      "\n",
      "We have a lot of ideas on what to do with our topic modelling service. But let’s focus on the main parts: modular approach instead of API calls and evaluation. The LangChain framework will help us with both topics, so let’s learn more about it.\n",
      "\n",
      "## LangChain Basics\n",
      "\n",
      "[LangChain](https://python.langchain.com/docs/get_started/introduction) is a framework for building applications powered by Language Models. Here are the main [components](https://docs.langchain.com/docs/category/components) of LangChain:\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Schema** is the most basic classes like Documents, Chat Messages and Texts.\n",
      "* **Models**. LangChain provides access to LLMs, Chat Models and Text Embedding models that you could easily use in your applications and switch between them if needed. It goes without saying it supports such popular models like ChatGPT, Anthropic and Llama.\n",
      "* **Prompts** is a functionality to help work with prompts, including prompt templates, output parsers and example selectors for few-shot prompting.\n",
      "* **Chains** are the core of LangChain (as you might guess by the name). Chains help you to build a sequence of blocks that will be executed. You can truly appreciate this functionality if you’re building a complex application.\n",
      "* **Indexes**: document loaders, text splitters, vector stores and retrievers. This module provides tools that help LLMs to interact with your documents. This functionality would be valuable if you’re building a Q&A use case. We won’t be using this functionality much in our example today.\n",
      "* LangChain provides a whole set of methods to manage and limit **memory**. This functionality is primarily needed for ChatBot scenarios.\n",
      "* One of the latest and most powerful features is **agents**. If you are a heavy ChatGPT user, you must have heard about the plugins. It’s the same idea that you can empower LLM with a set of custom or predefined tools (like Google Search or Wikipedia), and then the agent can use them while answering your questions. In this setup, LLM is acting like a reasoning agent and decides what it needs to do to achieve the result and when it gets the final answer that it could share. It’s exciting functionality, so it’s definitely worth a separate discussion.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, LangChain can help us build modular applications and be able to switch between different components (for example, from ChatGPT to Anthropic or from CSV as data input to Snowflake DB). LangChain has more than [190 integrations](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/providers), so that it can save you quite a lot of time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, we could reuse ready-made chains for [some use cases](https://python.langchain.com/docs/use_cases) instead of starting from scratch.\n",
      "\n",
      "When calling ChatGPT API manually, we have to manage quite a lot of Python glue code to make it work. It’s not a problem when you’re working on a small, straightforward task, but it might become unmanageable when you need to build something more complex and convoluted. In such cases, LangChain may help you eliminate this glue code and create more easy-to-maintain modular code.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, LangChain has its own limitations:\n",
      "\n",
      "* It’s primarily focused on OpenAI models, so it might not work so smoothly with on-premise open-source models.\n",
      "* The flip side of convenience is that it’s not easy to understand what’s going on under the hood and when and how the ChatGPT API you’re paying for is executed. You can use debug mode, but you need to specify it and go through the complete logs for a clearer view.\n",
      "* Despite pretty good documentation, I struggle from time to time to find answers to my questions. There are not so many other tutorials and resources on the internet apart from the official documentation, quite frequently you can see only official pages in Google.\n",
      "* The Langchain library is progressing a lot, and the team constantly ship new features. So, the library is not mature, and you might have to switch from the functionality you’re using. For example, the `SequentialChain` class is considered legacy now and might be deprecated in the future since they’ve introduced [LCEL](https://python.langchain.com/docs/expression_language/) – we will talk about it in more detail later on.\n",
      "\n",
      "We’ve gotten a birds-eye overview of LangChain functionality, but practice makes perfect. Let’s start using LangChain.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Enhancing topics’ assignment\n",
      "\n",
      "Let’s refactor the topic assignment since it will be the most common operation in our regular process, and it will help us understand how to use LangChain in practice.\n",
      "\n",
      "First of all, we need to install the package.\n",
      "\n",
      "```wp-block-prismatic-blocks\n",
      "!pip install --upgrade langchain\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "### Loading documents\n",
      "\n",
      "To work with the customers’ reviews, we first need to load them. For that, we could use [Document Loaders](https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/data_connection/document_loaders/). In our case, customer reviews are stored as a set of .txt files in a Directory, but you can effortlessly load docs from third-party tools. For example, there’s an [integration](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/document_loaders/snowflake) with Snowflake.\n",
      "\n",
      "We will use `DirectoryLoader` to load all files in the directory since we have separate files from hotels. For each file, we will specify `TextLoader` as a loader (by default, a loader for unstructured documents is used). Our files are encoded in `ISO-8859–1`, so the default call returns an error. However, LangChain can automatically detect used encoding. With such a setup, it works ok.\n",
      "\n",
      "```wp-block-prismatic-blocks\n",
      "from langchain.document_loaders import TextLoader, DirectoryLoader\n",
      "\n",
      "text_loader_kwargs={'autodetect_encoding': True}\n",
      "loader = DirectoryLoader('./hotels/london', show_progress=True, \n",
      "    loader_cls=TextLoader, loader_kwargs=text_loader_kwargs)\n",
      "\n",
      "docs = loader.load()\n",
      "len(docs)\n",
      "82\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "### Splitting documents\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, we would like to split our documents. We know that each file consists of a set of customer comments delimited by `n`. Since our case is very straightforward, we will use the most basic `CharacterTextSplitter` that splits documents by character. When working with real documents (whole long texts instead of independent short comments), it’s better to use [Recursive split by character](https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/data_connection/document_transformers/text_splitters/recursive_text_splitter) since it allows you to split documents into chunks smarter.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, LangChain is more suited for fuzzy text splitting. So, I had to hack it a bit to make it work the way I wanted.\n",
      "\n",
      "How it works:\n",
      "\n",
      "* You specify `chunk_size` and `chunk_overlap`, and it tries to make the minimal number of splits so that each chunk is smaller than `chunk_size`. If it fails to create a small enough chunk, it prints a message to the Jupyter Notebook output.\n",
      "* If you specify too big `chunk_size`, not all comments will be separated.\n",
      "* If you specify too small `chunk_size`, you will have print statements for each comment in your output, leading to the Notebook reloading. Unfortunately, I couldn’t find any parameters to switch it off.\n",
      "\n",
      "To overcome this problem, I specified `length_function` as a constant equal to `chunk_size`. Then I got just a standard split by character. LangChain provides enough flexibility to do what you want, but only in a somewhat hacky way.\n",
      "\n",
      "```wp-block-prismatic-blocks\n",
      "from langchain.text_splitter import CharacterTextSplitter\n",
      "\n",
      "text_splitter = CharacterTextSplitter(\n",
      "    separator = \"n\",\n",
      "    chunk_size = 1,\n",
      "    chunk_overlap  = 0,\n",
      "    length_function = lambda x: 1, # usually len is used \n",
      "    is_separator_regex = False\n",
      ")\n",
      "split_docs = text_splitter.split_documents(docs)\n",
      "len(split_docs) \n",
      "12890\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, let’s add the document ID to the metadata – we will use it later.\n",
      "\n",
      "```wp-block-prismatic-blocks\n",
      "for i in range(len(split_docs)):\n",
      "    split_docs[i].metadata['id'] = i\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "The advantage of using Documents is that we now have automatic data sources and can filter data by it. For example, we can filter only comments related to Travelodge Hotel.\n",
      "\n",
      "```wp-block-prismatic-blocks\n",
      "list(filter(\n",
      "    lambda x: 'travelodge' in x.metadata['source'],\n",
      "    split_docs\n",
      "))\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, we need a model. As we discussed earlier in LangChain, there are LLMs and Chat Models. The main difference is that LLMs take texts and return texts, while Chat Models are more suitable for conversational use cases and can get a set of messages as input. In our case, we will use the ChatModel for OpenAI since we would like to pass system messages as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "```wp-block-prismatic-blocks\n",
      "from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI\n",
      "\n",
      "chat = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0.0, model=\"gpt-3.5-turbo\", \n",
      "  openai_api_key = \"your_key\")\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "### Prompts\n",
      "\n",
      "Let’s move on to the most important part – our prompt. In LangChain, there’s a concept of Prompt Templates. They help to reuse prompts parametrised by variables. It’s helpful since, in real-life applications, prompts might be very detailed and sophisticated. So, prompt templates can be a useful high-level abstraction that would help you to manage your code effectively.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since we are going to use the Chat Model, we will need [ChatPromptTemplate.](https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/model_io/prompts/prompt_templates/#chatprompttemplate)\n",
      "\n",
      "But before jumping into prompts, let’s briefly discuss a helpful feature – an output parser. Surprisingly, they can help us to create an effective prompt. We can define the desired output, generate an output parser and then use the parser to create instructions for the prompt.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let’s define what we would like to see in the output. First, we would like to be able to pass a list of customer reviews to the prompt to process them in batches, so in the result, we would like to get a list with the following parameters:\n",
      "\n",
      "* id to identify documents,\n",
      "* list of topics from the predefined list (we will be using the list from our previous iteration),\n",
      "* sentiment (negative, neutral or positive).\n",
      "\n",
      "Let’s specify our output parser. Since we need a pretty complex JSON structure, we will use [Pydantic Output Parser](https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/model_io/output_parsers/pydantic) instead of the most commonly used [Structured Output Parser](https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/model_io/output_parsers/structured).\n",
      "\n",
      "For that, we need to create a class inherited from `BaseModel` and specify all fields we need\n",

      "## 1. **LLM Application Frameworks (LangChain)**\n",
      "The primary focus is on **LangChain** as a production framework for building LLM-powered applications. This represents the trend toward standardized frameworks that reduce \"glue code\" and enable modular, maintainable LLM solutions with 190+ integrations.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 2. **Production-Ready LLM Systems**\n",

      "- Continuous evaluation and monitoring\n",
      "- Feedback loops for model improvement\n",
      "- Cost optimization through batch processing\n",
      "- Sustainable, automated pipelines\n",
      "\n",
      "## 3. **Modular LLM Architecture**\n",
      "Advocates for **modularity and flexibility** in LLM applications, enabling teams to:\n",
      "- Easily switch between different LLM providers (ChatGPT, Anthropic, Llama)\n",
      "- Swap data sources and integrations\n",
      "- Iterate quickly as the LLM industry evolves\n",
      "\n",
      "## 4. **LLM Agents and Tool Use**\n",
      "Mentions **agentic AI** capabilities where LLMs act as reasoning agents that can:\n",
      "- Use plugins and external tools (Google Search, Wikipedia)\n",
      "- Make autonomous decisions about what actions to take\n",

      "Article Title: Production-Ready LLMs Made Simple with the NeMo Agent Toolkit\n",
      "\n",
      "Article Content (excerpt):\n",
      "When I saw that Nvidia had launched its own LLM agent framework, the [NeMo Agent Toolkit](https://docs.nvidia.com/nemo/agent-toolkit/latest/index.html) (or NAT), I got really excited. We usually think of Nvidia as the company powering the entire LLM hype with its GPUs, so it’s fascinating to see them go beyond hardware and step into the software space as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are already plenty of LLM agent frameworks out there: [LangGraph](https://towardsdatascience.com/from-basics-to-advanced-exploring-langgraph-e8c1cf4db787/), [smolagents](https://towardsdatascience.com/code-agents-the-future-of-agentic-ai/), [CrewAI](https://towardsdatascience.com/multi-ai-agent-systems-101-bac58e3bcc47/) and [DSPy](https://towardsdatascience.com/programming-not-prompting-a-hands-on-guide-to-dspy/), just to name a few. The [NeMo Agent Toolkit](https://docs.nvidia.com/nemo/agent-toolkit/latest/index.html), however, feels a bit different. I would describe it as a kind of glue that helps stitch all the pieces together and turn them into a production-ready solution.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nvidia positions this framework as a way to tackle “day 2” problems: exposing agents as APIs, adding observability to monitor your system and investigate edge cases, building evaluations, and reusing agents created in other frameworks.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this article, I’ll explore the core capabilities of the NeMo Agent Toolkit in practice, starting with a simple chat-completion app and gradually moving toward a hierarchical agentic setup, where one LLM agent can recursively use other agents as tools. Since it’s the festive season, I’ll be using publicly available data from the [World Happiness Report](https://worldhappiness.report/) to keep things cheerful.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Setting up\n",
      "\n",
      "As usual, we will start by setting up the environment and installing the package.\n",
      "\n",
      "The core package itself is fairly lightweight. However, as I mentioned earlier, NAT is designed to act as glue allowing to integrate with different LLM frameworks in your workflow. Because of that, there are several optional plugins available for popular libraries such as LangChain, CrewAI, and LlamaIndex. You can always find the most up-to-date list of supported plugins in [the official documentation](https://docs.nvidia.com/nemo/agent-toolkit/latest/quick-start/installing.html).   \n",
      "In this article, we will be using LangChain, so we’ll need to install the corresponding extension as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "> ***Tip:** NAT works MUCH better and faster with `uv`. I initially tried installing everything with `pip`, and it failed after about 20 minutes of waiting. I’d strongly recommend not repeating my mistakes.*\n",
      "\n",
      "First, create and activate a virtual environment using `uv`.\n",
      "\n",
      "```wp-block-prismatic-blocks\n",
      "uv venv .venv_nat_uv --python 3.12\n",
      "source .venv_nat_uv/bin/activate\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "Then install NAT with the LangChain plugin.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "## 2. **Framework Interoperability and Integration**\n",
      "Rather than being another standalone framework, NAT acts as \"glue\" that integrates with existing popular frameworks (LangGraph, LangChain, CrewAI, LlamaIndex, DSPy), highlighting a trend toward composable, multi-framework AI architectures.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 3. **Agentic AI with Tool Use**\n",
      "The article demonstrates the evolution from simple chat completion to tool-equipped agents that can access and analyze real data, representing the broader shift toward functional agents that can take actions rather than just generate text.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 4. **Configuration-Driven AI Development**\n",
      "NAT's YAML-based configuration approach for defining workflows, LLMs, and agent behaviors represents a trend toward declarative, infrastructure-as-code practices in AI development, making experimentation and deployment more reproducible.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 5. **Hardware Companies Expanding into AI Software**\n",

      "\n",
      "Article Content (excerpt):\n",
      "Having spent over a decade working in analytics, I firmly believe that observability and evaluation are essential for any LLM application running in production. Monitoring and metrics aren’t just nice-to-haves. They ensure your product is functioning as expected and that each new update is actually moving you in the right direction.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this article, I want to share my experience with the observability and evaluation features of the NeMo Agent Toolkit (NAT). If you haven’t read [my previous article](https://towardsdatascience.com/production-ready-llms-made-simple-with-nemo-agent-toolkit/) on NAT, here’s a quick refresher: NAT is Nvidia’s framework for building production-ready LLM applications. Think of it as the glue that connects LLMs, tools, and workflows, while also offering deployment and observability options.\n",
      "\n",
      "Using NAT, we built a Happiness Agent capable of answering nuanced questions about [the World Happiness report data](https://www.worldhappiness.report/) and performing calculations based on real metrics. Our focus was on building agentic flows, integrating agents from other frameworks as tools (in our example, a LangGraph-based calculator agent), and deploying the application both as a REST API and a user-friendly interface.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this article, I’ll dive into my favourite topics: observability and evaluations. After all, as the saying goes, you can’t improve what you don’t measure. So, without further ado, let’s jump in.\n",

      "## Observability\n",
      "\n",
      "Let’s start with observability — the ability to track what’s happening inside your application, including all intermediate steps, tools used, timings, and token usage. The NeMo Agent Toolkit integrates with a variety of observability tools such as Phoenix, W&B Weave, and Catalyst. You can always check the latest list of supported frameworks in [the documentation](https://docs.nvidia.com/nemo/agent-toolkit/latest/workflows/observe/index.html).\n",
      "\n",

Higher scores indicate that the model’s answer closely matches the reference.\n",

      "[**Response Groundedness**](https://docs.ragas.io/en/stable/concepts/metrics/available_metrics/nvidia_metrics/#response-groundedness) evaluates whether a response is supported by the retrieved contexts. That is, whether each claim can be found (fully or partially) in the provided data. This works similarly to Answer Accuracy, using two distinct “LLM-as-a-Judge” prompts with ratings of 0, 1, or 2, which are then normalised to a [0,1] scale.\n",

Before LLMs, if we wanted to do sentiment analysis or chatbot, we would first spend several months getting labelled data and training models.

      "\n",
      "## LLM basics\n",
      "\n",
      "Before jumping into our task, let’s discuss the basics of LLMs and how they could be used.\n",
      "\n",
      "Large Language Models are trained on enormous amounts of text to predict the next word for the sentence. It’s a straightforward supervised Machine Learning task: we have the set of the sentences’ beginnings and the following words for them.\n",
      "\n",
      "![Graph by author](https://towardsdatascience.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1TI8V97vrVyWBFIpIslASJQ.png)\n",
      "\n",
      "Graph by author\n",
      "\n",
      "You can play with a basic LLM, for example, `text-davinci-003`, on [nat.dev](https://nat.dev/).\n",
      "\n",
      "In most business applications, we need not a generic model but one that can solve problems. Basic LLMs are not perfect for such tasks because they are trained to predict the most likely next word. But on the internet, there are a lot of texts where the next word is not a correct answer, for example, jokes or just a list of questions to prepare for the exam.\n",
      "\n",
      "That’s why, nowadays, Instruction Tuned LLMs are very popular for business cases. These models are basic LLMs, fine-tuned on datasets with instructions and good answers (for example, [OpenOrca dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Open-Orca/OpenOrca)). Also, RLHF (Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback) approach is often used to train such models.\n",
      "\n",
      "The other important feature of Instruction Tuned LLMs is that they are trying to be helpful, honest and harmless, which is crucial for the models that will communicate with customers (especially vulnerable ones).\n",
      "\n",
      "## What are the primary tasks for LLMs\n",
      "\n",
      "LLMs are primarily used for tasks with unstructured data (not the cases when you have a table with lots of numbers). Here is the list of the most common applications for texts:\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Summarisation** – giving a concise overview of the text.\n",
      "* **Text analysis**, for example, sentiment analysis or extracting specific features (for example, labels mentioned in hotel reviews).\n",
      "* **Text transformations** include translating to different languages, changing tone, or formatting from HTML to JSON.\n",
      "* **Generation**, for example, to generate a story from a prompt, respond to customer questions or help to brainstorm about some problem.\n",
      "\n",
      "It looks like our task of topic modelling is the one where LLMs could be rather beneficial. It’s an example of **Text analysis**.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Prompt Engineering 101\n",
      "\n",
      "We give tasks to LLMs using instructions that are often called prompts. You can think of LLM as a very motivated and knowledgeable junior specialist who is ready to help but needs clear instructions to follow. So, a prompt is critical.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are a few main principles that you should take into account while creating prompts.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Principle #1: Be as clear and specific as possible\n",
      "\n",
      "* Use delimiters to split different sections of your prompt, for example, separating different steps in the instruction or framing user message. The common delimeters are `\"\"\"` , `---` , `###` , `<>` or XML tags.\n",
      "* Define the format for the output. For example, you could use JSON or HTML and even specify a list of possible values. It will make response parsing much easier for you.\n",
      "* Show a couple of input & output examples to the model so it can see what you expect as separate messages. Such an approach is called few-shot prompting.\n",
      "* Also, it could be helpful to instruct the model to check assumptions and conditions. For example, to ensure that the output format is JSON and returned values are from the specified list.\n",
      "\n",
      "### **Principle #2:** Push the model to think about the answer\n",
      "\n",
      "Daniel Kahneman’s famous book \"Thinking Fast and Slow\" shows that our mind consists of 2 systems. System 1 works instinctively and allows us to give answers extremely quickly and with minimal effort (this system helped our ancestors to survive after meeting tigers). System 2 requires more time and concentration to get an answer. We tend to use System 1 in as many situations as possible because it’s more effective for basic tasks. Surprisingly, LLMs do the same and often jump to conclusions.\n",
      "\n",
      "We can push the model to think before answering and increase the quality.\n",
      "\n",
      "* We can give a model step-by-step instructions to force it to go through all the steps and don’t rush to conclusions. This approach is called \"Chain of thought\" reasoning.\n",
      "* The other approach is to split your complex task into smaller ones and use different prompts for each elementary step. Such an approach has multiple advantages: it’s easier to support this code (good analogy: spaghetti code vs. modular one); it may be less costly (you don’t need to write long instructions for all possible cases); you can augment external tools at specific points of the workflow or include human in the loop.\n",
      "* With the above approaches, we don’t need to share all the reasoning with the end user. We can just keep it as an inner monologue.\n",
      "* Suppose we want the model to check some results (for example, from the other model or students). In that case, we can ask it to independently get the result first or evaluate it against the list of criteria before coming to conclusions.\n",
      "\n",
      "You can find an example of a helpful system prompt from Jeremy Howard that pushes the model to reason in [this jupyter notebook](https://github.com/fastai/lm-hackers/blob/main/lm-hackers.ipynb).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Principle #3: Beware hallucinations\n",
      "\n",
      "The well-known problem of LLMs is hallucinations. It’s when a model tells you information that looks plausible but not true.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, if you ask GPT to provide the most popular papers on DALL-E 3, two out of three URLs are invalid.\n",
      "\n",
      "![](https://towardsdatascience.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1CS2V_Xhzau_hRM91mlKmEw.png)\n",
      "\n",
      "The common sources of hallucinations:\n",
      "\n",
      "* The model doesn’t see many URLs, and it doesn’t know much about it. So, it tends to create fake URLs.\n",
      "* It doesn’t know about itself (because there was no info about GPT-4 when the model was pre-trained).\n",
      "* The model doesn’t have real-time data and will likely tell you something random if you ask about recent events.\n",
      "\n",
      "To reduce hallucinations, you can try the following approaches:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Ask the model to link the answer to the relevant information from the context, then answer the question based on the found data.\n",
      "* In the end, ask the model to validate the result based on provided factual information.\n",
      "\n",
      "> Remember that Prompt Engineering is an iterative process. It’s unlikely that you will be able to solve your task ideally from the first attempt. It’s worth trying multiple prompts on a set of example inputs.\n",
      "\n",
      "The other thought-provoking idea about LLM answers’ quality is that if the model starts to tell you absurd or non-relevant things, it’s likely to proceed. Because, on the internet, if you see a thread where nonsense is discussed, the following discussion will likely be of poor quality. So, if you’re using the model in a chat mode (passing the previous conversation as the context), it might be worth starting from scratch.\n",
      "\n",
      "## ChatGPT API\n",
      "\n",
      "ChatGPT from OpenAI is one of the most popular LLMs now, so for this example, we will be using ChatGPT API.\n",
      "\n",
      "For now, GPT-4 is the best-performing LLM we have (according to [fasteval](https://fasteval.github.io/FastEval/)). However, it may be enough for non-chat tasks to use the previous version, GPT-3.5.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Setting up account\n",
      "\n",
      "To use ChatGPT API, you need to register on [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com/). As usual, you can use authentication from Google. Keep in mind that ChatGPT API access is not related to the ChatGPT Plus subscription you might have.\n",
      "\n",
      "After registration, you also need to top up your balance. Since you will pay for API calls as you go. You can do it at the \"Billing\" tab. The process is straightforward: you need to fill in your card details and the initial amount you are ready to pay.\n",
      "\n",
      "The last important step is to create an API Key (a secret key you will use to access API). You can do it at the \"API Keys\" tab. Ensure you save the key since you won’t be able to access it afterwards. However, you can create a new key if you’ve lost the previous one.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Pricing\n",
      "\n",
      "As I mentioned, you will be paying for API calls, so understanding how it works is worth it. I advise you to look through [the Pricing documentation](https://openai.com/pricing) for the most up-to-date info.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, the price depends on the model and the number of tokens. The more complex model would cost you more: ChatGPT 4 is more expensive than ChatGPT 3.5, and ChatGPT 3.5 with 16K context is more costly than ChatGPT 3.5 with 4K context. You will also have slightly different prices for input tokens (your prompt) and output (model response).\n",
      "\n",
      "However, all prices are for 1K tokens, so one of the main factors is the size of your input and output.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let’s discuss what a token is. The model splits text into tokens (widely used words or parts of the word). For the English language, one token on average is around four characters, and each word is 1.33 tokens.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let’s see how one of our hotels review will be split into tokens.\n",

      "**MCP (Model Context Protocol)** is a method to standardise communication between AI applications and external tools or data sources. This standardisation helps to reduce the number of integrations needed (*from N\\*M to N+M*):\n",
      "\n",
      "* You can use community-built MCP servers when you need common functionality, saving time and avoiding the need to reinvent the wheel every time.\n",
      "* You can also expose your own tools and resources, making them available for others to use.\n",
      "\n",
      "In [my previous article](https://towardsdatascience.com/your-personal-analytics-toolbox/), we built the analytics toolbox (a collection of tools that might automate your day-to-day routine). We built an MCP server and used its capabilities with existing clients like MCP Inspector or Claude Desktop.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, we want to use those tools directly in our AI applications. To do that, let’s build our own MCP client. We will write fairly low-level code, which will also give you a clearer picture of how tools like Claude Code interact with MCP under the hood.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, I would like to implement the feature that is currently (*July 2025*) missing from Claude Desktop: the ability for the LLM to automatically check whether it has a suitable prompt template for the task at hand and use it. Right now, you have to pick the template manually, which isn’t very convenient.\n",

      "As a bonus, I will also share a high-level implementation using the smolagents framework, which is ideal for scenarios when you work only with MCP tools and don’t need much customisation.\n",

      "\n",
      "## 1. **Model Context Protocol (MCP) - Standardization of AI Integrations**\n",
      "The article centers on MCP, Anthropic's protocol for standardizing how LLMs interact with external tools and data sources. This represents a shift toward reducing integration complexity from N×M to N+M connections, enabling reusable, community-built servers and promoting interoperability across AI applications.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 2. **Client-Server Architecture for AI Applications**\n",
      "The article demonstrates the three-component MCP architecture:\n",
      "- **Host** (user-facing application)\n",
      "- **MCP Client** (connection layer)\n",
      "- **MCP Server** (exposes tools, prompts, and resources)\n",
      "\n",
      "This pattern represents an emerging trend of modular, protocol-based AI system design rather than monolithic applications.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 3. **Autonomous Tool Selection and Dynamic Prompt Templates**\n",
      "A notable feature discussed is automatic prompt template selection—enabling the LLM to independently determine and apply appropriate prompt templates for tasks, rather than requiring manual user selection. This reflects the broader trend toward more autonomous AI agents.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 4. **Low-Level AI Agent Implementation vs. High-Level Frameworks**\n",
      "The article contrasts building custom MCP clients from scratch (for understanding and customization) with using frameworks like **smolagents** for rapid development when working exclusively with MCP tools. This highlights the maturation of the agentic AI ecosystem with multiple abstraction levels.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 5. **Multi-Tool Integration for AI Agents**\n",
      "The practical implementation connects to multiple specialized MCP servers (analytics toolkit, filesystem, web fetch), demonstrating the trend toward AI agents that orchestrate multiple specialized tools rather than single-purpose applications.\u001b[0m\n",

      "--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "# Key AI Trends and Concepts from the Article\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on this 2025 article, here are the main AI trends and concepts discussed:\n",
      "\n",
      "## 1. **Agentic AI and Reflection Design Pattern**\n",
      "The core focus is on **reflection** as a fundamental agentic design pattern where LLMs iteratively review and improve their outputs through feedback loops, mimicking human work processes. This enables AI agents to self-critique and refine results rather than generating responses in a single pass.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 2. **Building AI Systems from First Principles**\n",
      "A trend toward understanding AI tools \"from scratch\" rather than relying solely on high-level frameworks. The article advocates working directly with foundation model APIs to gain deeper understanding of how agentic systems actually work.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 3. **Self-Correction and Iterative Refinement Techniques**\n",
      "Key methodologies cited include:\n",
      "- **Self-Refine** (self-feedback loops)\n",
      "- **Reflexion** (verbal reinforcement learning)\n",
      "- **CRITIC** (tool-interactive critiquing with external feedback)\n",
      "- **ReAct** (combining reasoning and acting)\n",
      "\n",
      "These approaches show 10-30% performance improvements across diverse tasks.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 4. **Popular Agentic AI Frameworks**\n",
      "Mentioned tools and frameworks include: GitHub Copilot, Claude Desktop, OpenAI Operator, Perplexity Comet, CrewAI, smolagents, DSPy, and LangGraph.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 5. **Production Trade-offs: Quality vs. Cost/Latency**\n",
      "Recognition that reflection's quality improvements must be balanced against increased API calls, latency, and costs—a key consideration for real-world business applications.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Beyond Prompting: The Power of Context Engineering\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "# Key AI Trends and Concepts from the Article\n",
      "\n",
      "## 1. **Context Engineering as a Discipline**\n",
      "A systematic approach to optimizing what information goes into an LLM's prompt, positioning itself as a cost-effective alternative to fine-tuning. Focuses on making \"self-improving\" systems that learn from experience without retraining model parameters.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 2. **Evolution from Static to Self-Improving Contexts**\n",
      "Progression through three stages:\n",
      "- **Static prompting** (hand-crafted, fixed instructions)\n",
      "- **Dynamic retrieval** (RAG - Retrieval-Augmented Generation)\n",

      "--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "# Key AI Trends and Concepts from the Article\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on this 2025 article, here are the main AI trends and concepts discussed:\n",
      "\n",
      "## 1. **Agentic AI and Reflection Design Pattern**\n",
      "The core focus is on **reflection** as a fundamental agentic design pattern where LLMs iteratively review and improve their outputs through feedback loops, mimicking human work processes. This enables AI agents to self-critique and refine results rather than generating responses in a single pass.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 2. **Building AI Systems from First Principles**\n",
      "A trend toward understanding AI tools \"from scratch\" rather than relying solely on high-level frameworks. The article advocates working directly with foundation model APIs to gain deeper understanding of how agentic systems actually work.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 3. **Self-Correction and Iterative Refinement Techniques**\n",
      "Key methodologies cited include:\n",
      "- **Self-Refine** (self-feedback loops)\n",
      "- **Reflexion** (verbal reinforcement learning)\n",
      "- **CRITIC** (tool-interactive critiquing with external feedback)\n",
      "- **ReAct** (combining reasoning and acting)\n",
      "\n",
      "These approaches show 10-30% performance improvements across diverse tasks.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 4. **Popular Agentic AI Frameworks**\n",
      "Mentioned tools and frameworks include: GitHub Copilot, Claude Desktop, OpenAI Operator, Perplexity Comet, CrewAI, smolagents, DSPy, and LangGraph.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 5. **Production Trade-offs: Quality vs. Cost/Latency**\n",
      "Recognition that reflection's quality improvements must be balanced against increased API calls, latency, and costs—a key consideration for real-world business applications.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Beyond Prompting: The Power of Context Engineering\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "# Key AI Trends and Concepts from the Article\n",
      "\n",
      "## 1. **Context Engineering as a Discipline**\n",
      "A systematic approach to optimizing what information goes into an LLM's prompt, positioning itself as a cost-effective alternative to fine-tuning. Focuses on making \"self-improving\" systems that learn from experience without retraining model parameters.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 2. **Evolution from Static to Self-Improving Contexts**\n",
      "Progression through three stages:\n",
      "- **Static prompting** (hand-crafted, fixed instructions)\n",
      "- **Dynamic retrieval** (RAG - Retrieval-Augmented Generation)\n",
      "- **Self-improving contexts** (adaptive systems that update based on past performance)\n",
      "\n",
      "## 3. **Agentic Context Engineering (ACE) Framework**\n",
      "A novel 2025 approach that addresses \"brevity bias\" and \"context collapse\" through:\n",
      "- Structured \"playbook\" of reusable knowledge bullets with metadata\n",
      "- Three-component loop: Generator → Reflector → Curator\n",
      "- Incremental delta updates rather than full prompt rewrites\n",
      "- 83.6% lower token costs with +10.6% performance improvement on benchmarks\n",
      "\n",
      "## 4. **Natural Language-Based Learning Methods**\n",
      "Emergence of frameworks using verbal/textual feedback instead of gradient-based updates:\n",
      "- **Reflexion** - learning through natural language reflection\n",
      "- **TextGrad** - \"backpropagation\" using textual critiques\n",
      "- **GEPA** - evolutionary algorithms with prompt mutation and selection\n",
      "\n",
      "## 5. **Test-Time Learning and Adaptive Memory**\n",
      "Systems that accumulate and reuse knowledge during inference without explicit retraining, enabling continuous improvement through persistent memory mechanisms.\n",
      "\n",

      "## 1. **LLM Agents and Agentic AI**\n",
      "The article introduces **LLM agents** as a paradigm shift from predefined workflows to autonomous reasoning systems. Instead of hardcoding every step, agents use LLMs as a \"reasoning engine\" to dynamically choose actions and determine when to return final answers—mirroring how human analysts work.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 2. **Tool-Using LLMs (Function Calling)**\n",
      "The article focuses on **OpenAI function calling** as a critical capability that allows LLMs to interact with external systems. This enables LLMs to invoke tools like SQL executors, calculators, or search engines, bridging the gap between language models and real-world data systems.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 3. **Structured Output via Function Calling**\n",
      "Two key use cases for functions are highlighted:\n",
      "- **Tagging & Extraction**: Using function calls to ensure structured, validated output formats instead of unstructured text\n",
      "- **Tools & Routing**: Enabling agent-like behavior where LLMs can select and execute appropriate tools\n",

      "This pattern represents an emerging trend of modular, protocol-based AI system design rather than monolithic applications.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 3. **Autonomous Tool Selection and Dynamic Prompt Templates**\n",
      "A notable feature discussed is automatic prompt template selection—enabling the LLM to independently determine and apply appropriate prompt templates for tasks, rather than requiring manual user selection. This reflects the broader trend toward more autonomous AI agents.\n",

      "\n",
      "## 2. **Framework Interoperability and Integration**\n",
      "Rather than being another standalone framework, NAT acts as \"glue\" that integrates with existing popular frameworks (LangGraph, LangChain, CrewAI, LlamaIndex, DSPy), highlighting a trend toward composable, multi-framework AI architectures.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 3. **Agentic AI with Tool Use**\n",
      "The article demonstrates the evolution from simple chat completion to tool-equipped agents that can access and analyze real data, representing the broader shift toward functional agents that can take actions rather than just generate text.\n",
