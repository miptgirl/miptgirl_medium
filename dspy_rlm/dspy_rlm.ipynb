Clarke’s Third Law says that “*any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic*”. That’s exactly how a lot of today’s AI frameworks feel. Tools like GitHub Copilot, Claude Desktop, OpenAI Operator, and Perplexity Comet are automating everyday tasks that would’ve seemed impossible to automate just five years ago. What’s even more remarkable is that with just a few lines of code, we can build our own sophisticated AI tools: ones that search through files, browse the web, click links, and even make purchases. It really does feel like magic.\\n\\nEven though I [genuinely believe in data wizards](https://towardsdatascience.com/i-think-of-analysts-as-data-wizards-who-help-their-product-teams-solve-problems/), I don’t believe in magic. I find it exciting (and often helpful) to understand how things are actually built and what’s happening under the hood. That’s why I’ve decided to share a series of posts on agentic AI design concepts that’ll help you understand how all these magical tools actually work.\\n\\nTo gain a deep understanding, we’ll build a multi-AI agent system from scratch. We’ll avoid using frameworks like CrewAI or smolagents and instead work directly with the foundation model API. Along the way, we’ll explore the fundamental agentic design patterns: reflection, tool use, planning, and multi-agent setups. Then, we’ll combine all this knowledge to build a multi-AI agent system that can answer complex data-related questions.\\n\\nAs Richard Feynman put it, “*What I cannot create, I do not understand*.” So let’s start building!

      "\n",
      "Article Content (excerpt):\n",
      "When I saw that Nvidia had launched its own LLM agent framework, the [NeMo Agent Toolkit](https://docs.nvidia.com/nemo/agent-toolkit/latest/index.html) (or NAT), I got really excited. We usually think of Nvidia as the company powering the entire LLM hype with its GPUs, so it’s fascinating to see them go beyond hardware and step into the software space as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are already plenty of LLM agent frameworks out there: [LangGraph](https://towardsdatascience.com/from-basics-to-advanced-exploring-langgraph-e8c1cf4db787/), [smolagents](https://towardsdatascience.com/code-agents-the-future-of-agentic-ai/), [CrewAI](https://towardsdatascience.com/multi-ai-agent-systems-101-bac58e3bcc47/) and [DSPy](https://towardsdatascience.com/programming-not-prompting-a-hands-on-guide-to-dspy/), just to name a few. The [NeMo Agent Toolkit](https://docs.nvidia.com/nemo/agent-toolkit/latest/index.html), however, feels a bit different. I would describe it as a kind of glue that helps stitch all the pieces together and turn them into a production-ready solution.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nvidia positions this framework as a way to tackle “day 2” problems: exposing agents as APIs, adding observability to monitor your system and investigate edge cases, building evaluations, and reusing agents created in other frameworks.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this article, I’ll explore the core capabilities of the NeMo Agent Toolkit in practice, starting with a simple chat-completion app and gradually moving toward a hierarchical agentic setup, where one LLM agent can recursively use other agents as tools. Since it’s the festive season, I’ll be using publicly available data from the [World Happiness Report](https://worldhappiness.report/) to keep things cheerful.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Setting up\n",
      "\n",
      "As usual, we will start by setting up the environment and installing the package.\n",
      "\n",
      "The core package itself is fairly lightweight. However, as I mentioned earlier, NAT is designed to act as glue allowing to integrate with different LLM frameworks in your workflow. Because of that, there are several optional plugins available for popular libraries such as LangChain, CrewAI, and LlamaIndex. You can always find the most up-to-date list of supported plugins in [the official documentation](https://docs.nvidia.com/nemo/agent-toolkit/latest/quick-start/installing.html).   \n",

      "The NeMo Agent Toolkit (NAT) represents a shift toward frameworks designed specifically for \"day 2\" problems - moving beyond prototyping to production deployment with features like API exposure, observability, monitoring, and evaluation systems.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 2. **Framework Interoperability and Integration**\n",
      "Rather than being another standalone framework, NAT acts as \"glue\" that integrates with existing popular frameworks (LangGraph, LangChain, CrewAI, LlamaIndex, DSPy), highlighting a trend toward composable, multi-framework AI architectures.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 3. **Agentic AI with Tool Use**\n",
      "The article demonstrates the evolution from simple chat completion to tool-equipped agents that can access and analyze real data, representing the broader shift toward functional agents that can take actions rather than just generate text.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 4. **Configuration-Driven AI Development**\n",
      "NAT's YAML-based configuration approach for defining workflows, LLMs, and agent behaviors represents a trend toward declarative, infrastructure-as-code practices in AI development, making experimentation and deployment more reproducible.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 5. **Hardware Companies Expanding into AI Software**\n",

      "Having spent over a decade working in analytics, I firmly believe that observability and evaluation are essential for any LLM application running in production. Monitoring and metrics aren’t just nice-to-haves. They ensure your product is functioning as expected and that each new update is actually moving you in the right direction.\n",
      "\n",

If you haven’t read [my previous article](https://towardsdatascience.com/production-ready-llms-made-simple-with-nemo-agent-toolkit/) on NAT, here’s a quick refresher: NAT is Nvidia’s framework for building production-ready LLM applications. Think of it as the glue that connects LLMs, tools, and workflows, while also offering deployment and observability options.\n",
      "\n",
      "Using NAT, we built a Happiness Agent capable of answering nuanced questions about [the World Happiness report data](https://www.worldhappiness.report/) and performing calculations based on real metrics. Our focus was on building agentic flows, integrating agents from other frameworks as tools (in our example, a LangGraph-based calculator agent), and deploying the application both as a REST API and a user-friendly interface.\n",

      "Let’s start with observability — the ability to track what’s happening inside your application, including all intermediate steps, tools used, timings, and token usage. The NeMo Agent Toolkit integrates with a variety of observability tools such as Phoenix, W&B Weave, and Catalyst. You can always check the latest list of supported frameworks in [the documentation](https://docs.nvidia.com/nemo/agent-toolkit/latest/workflows/observe/index.html).\n",
      "\n",

Higher scores indicate that the model’s answer closely matches the reference.\n",

      "[**Response Groundedness**](https://docs.ragas.io/en/stable/concepts/metrics/available_metrics/nvidia_metrics/#response-groundedness) evaluates whether a response is supported by the retrieved contexts. That is, whether each claim can be found (fully or partially) in the provided data. This works similarly to Answer Accuracy, using two distinct “LLM-as-a-Judge” prompts with ratings of 0, 1, or 2, which are then normalised to a [0,1] scale.\n",

      "* 0 → Not grounded at all,\n",
      "* 1 → Partially grounded,\n",
      "* 2 → Fully grounded.\n",

      "**Trajectory Evaluation** tracks the intermediate steps and tool calls executed by the LLM, helping to monitor the reasoning process.

      "In [the previous article](https://towardsdatascience.com/topics-per-class-using-bertopic-252314f2640), I used BERTopic for Topic Modelling. The task was to compare the main topics in reviews for various hotel chains. This approach with BERTopic worked out, and we got some insights from the data. For example, from reviews, we could see that Holiday Inn, Travelodge and Park Inn have more reasonable prices for value.\n",

Before LLMs, if we wanted to do sentiment analysis or chatbot, we would first spend several months getting labelled data and training models. Then, we would deploy it in production (it would also take a couple of months at least). With LLMs, we can solve such problems within a few hours.\n",

      "\n",
      "## LLM basics\n",
      "\n",
      "Before jumping into our task, let’s discuss the basics of LLMs and how they could be used.\n",
      "\n",
      "Large Language Models are trained on enormous amounts of text to predict the next word for the sentence. It’s a straightforward supervised Machine Learning task: we have the set of the sentences’ beginnings and the following words for them.\n",
      "\n",
      "![Graph by author](https://towardsdatascience.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1TI8V97vrVyWBFIpIslASJQ.png)\n",
      "\n",
      "Graph by author\n",
      "\n",
      "You can play with a basic LLM, for example, `text-davinci-003`, on [nat.dev](https://nat.dev/).\n",
      "\n",
      "In most business applications, we need not a generic model but one that can solve problems. Basic LLMs are not perfect for such tasks because they are trained to predict the most likely next word. But on the internet, there are a lot of texts where the next word is not a correct answer, for example, jokes or just a list of questions to prepare for the exam.\n",
      "\n",
      "That’s why, nowadays, Instruction Tuned LLMs are very popular for business cases. These models are basic LLMs, fine-tuned on datasets with instructions and good answers (for example, [OpenOrca dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Open-Orca/OpenOrca)). Also, RLHF (Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback) approach is often used to train such models.\n",
      "\n",
      "The other important feature of Instruction Tuned LLMs is that they are trying to be helpful, honest and harmless, which is crucial for the models that will communicate with customers (especially vulnerable ones).\n",
      "\n",
      "## What are the primary tasks for LLMs\n",
      "\n",
      "LLMs are primarily used for tasks with unstructured data (not the cases when you have a table with lots of numbers). Here is the list of the most common applications for texts:\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Summarisation** – giving a concise overview of the text.\n",
      "* **Text analysis**, for example, sentiment analysis or extracting specific features (for example, labels mentioned in hotel reviews).\n",
      "* **Text transformations** include translating to different languages, changing tone, or formatting from HTML to JSON.\n",
      "* **Generation**, for example, to generate a story from a prompt, respond to customer questions or help to brainstorm about some problem.\n",
      "\n",
      "It looks like our task of topic modelling is the one where LLMs could be rather beneficial. It’s an example of **Text analysis**.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Prompt Engineering 101\n",
      "\n",
      "We give tasks to LLMs using instructions that are often called prompts. You can think of LLM as a very motivated and knowledgeable junior specialist who is ready to help but needs clear instructions to follow. So, a prompt is critical.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are a few main principles that you should take into account while creating prompts.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Principle #1: Be as clear and specific as possible\n",
      "\n",
      "* Use delimiters to split different sections of your prompt, for example, separating different steps in the instruction or framing user message. The common delimeters are `\"\"\"` , `---` , `###` , `<>` or XML tags.\n",
      "* Define the format for the output. For example, you could use JSON or HTML and even specify a list of possible values. It will make response parsing much easier for you.\n",
      "* Show a couple of input & output examples to the model so it can see what you expect as separate messages. Such an approach is called few-shot prompting.\n",
      "* Also, it could be helpful to instruct the model to check assumptions and conditions. For example, to ensure that the output format is JSON and returned values are from the specified list.\n",
      "\n",
      "### **Principle #2:** Push the model to think about the answer\n",
      "\n",
      "Daniel Kahneman’s famous book \"Thinking Fast and Slow\" shows that our mind consists of 2 systems. System 1 works instinctively and allows us to give answers extremely quickly and with minimal effort (this system helped our ancestors to survive after meeting tigers). System 2 requires more time and concentration to get an answer. We tend to use System 1 in as many situations as possible because it’s more effective for basic tasks. Surprisingly, LLMs do the same and often jump to conclusions.\n",
      "\n",
      "We can push the model to think before answering and increase the quality.\n",
      "\n",
      "* We can give a model step-by-step instructions to force it to go through all the steps and don’t rush to conclusions. This approach is called \"Chain of thought\" reasoning.\n",
      "* The other approach is to split your complex task into smaller ones and use different prompts for each elementary step. Such an approach has multiple advantages: it’s easier to support this code (good analogy: spaghetti code vs. modular one); it may be less costly (you don’t need to write long instructions for all possible cases); you can augment external tools at specific points of the workflow or include human in the loop.\n",
      "* With the above approaches, we don’t need to share all the reasoning with the end user. We can just keep it as an inner monologue.\n",
      "* Suppose we want the model to check some results (for example, from the other model or students). In that case, we can ask it to independently get the result first or evaluate it against the list of criteria before coming to conclusions.\n",
      "\n",
      "You can find an example of a helpful system prompt from Jeremy Howard that pushes the model to reason in [this jupyter notebook](https://github.com/fastai/lm-hackers/blob/main/lm-hackers.ipynb).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Principle #3: Beware hallucinations\n",
      "\n",
      "The well-known problem of LLMs is hallucinations. It’s when a model tells you information that looks plausible but not true.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, if you ask GPT to provide the most popular papers on DALL-E 3, two out of three URLs are invalid.\n",
      "\n",
      "![](https://towardsdatascience.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1CS2V_Xhzau_hRM91mlKmEw.png)\n",
      "\n",
      "The common sources of hallucinations:\n",
      "\n",
      "* The model doesn’t see many URLs, and it doesn’t know much about it. So, it tends to create fake URLs.\n",
      "* It doesn’t know about itself (because there was no info about GPT-4 when the model was pre-trained).\n",
      "* The model doesn’t have real-time data and will likely tell you something random if you ask about recent events.\n",
      "\n",
      "To reduce hallucinations, you can try the following approaches:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Ask the model to link the answer to the relevant information from the context, then answer the question based on the found data.\n",
      "* In the end, ask the model to validate the result based on provided factual information.\n",
      "\n",
      "> Remember that Prompt Engineering is an iterative process. It’s unlikely that you will be able to solve your task ideally from the first attempt. It’s worth trying multiple prompts on a set of example inputs.\n",
      "\n",
      "The other thought-provoking idea about LLM answers’ quality is that if the model starts to tell you absurd or non-relevant things, it’s likely to proceed. Because, on the internet, if you see a thread where nonsense is discussed, the following discussion will likely be of poor quality. So, if you’re using the model in a chat mode (passing the previous conversation as the context), it might be worth starting from scratch.\n",
      "\n",
      "## ChatGPT API\n",
      "\n",
      "ChatGPT from OpenAI is one of the most popular LLMs now, so for this example, we will be using ChatGPT API.\n",
      "\n",
      "For now, GPT-4 is the best-performing LLM we have (according to [fasteval](https://fasteval.github.io/FastEval/)). However, it may be enough for non-chat tasks to use the previous version, GPT-3.5.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Setting up account\n",
      "\n",
      "To use ChatGPT API, you need to register on [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com/). As usual, you can use authentication from Google. Keep in mind that ChatGPT API access is not related to the ChatGPT Plus subscription you might have.\n",
      "\n",
      "After registration, you also need to top up your balance. Since you will pay for API calls as you go. You can do it at the \"Billing\" tab. The process is straightforward: you need to fill in your card details and the initial amount you are ready to pay.\n",
      "\n",
      "The last important step is to create an API Key (a secret key you will use to access API). You can do it at the \"API Keys\" tab. Ensure you save the key since you won’t be able to access it afterwards. However, you can create a new key if you’ve lost the previous one.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Pricing\n",
      "\n",
      "As I mentioned, you will be paying for API calls, so understanding how it works is worth it. I advise you to look through [the Pricing documentation](https://openai.com/pricing) for the most up-to-date info.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, the price depends on the model and the number of tokens. The more complex model would cost you more: ChatGPT 4 is more expensive than ChatGPT 3.5, and ChatGPT 3.5 with 16K context is more costly than ChatGPT 3.5 with 4K context. You will also have slightly different prices for input tokens (your prompt) and output (model response).\n",
      "\n",
      "However, all prices are for 1K tokens, so one of the main factors is the size of your input and output.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let’s discuss what a token is. The model splits text into tokens (widely used words or parts of the word). For the English language, one token on average is around four characters, and each word is 1.33 tokens.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let’s see how one of our hotels review will be split into tokens.\n",
      "\n",
      "![](https://towardsdatascience.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1bpZKdNePnz6OjVGQHEqGoA.png)\n",

      "\n",
      "```wp-block-prismatic-blocks\n",

      "Article Content (excerpt):\n",
      "**MCP (Model Context Protocol)** is a method to standardise communication between AI applications and external tools or data sources. This standardisation helps to reduce the number of integrations needed (*from N\\*M to N+M*):\n",
      "\n",
      "* You can use community-built MCP servers when you need common functionality, saving time and avoiding the need to reinvent the wheel every time.\n",
      "* You can also expose your own tools and resources, making them available for others to use.\n",
      "\n",
      "In [my previous article](https://towardsdatascience.com/your-personal-analytics-toolbox/), we built the analytics toolbox (a collection of tools that might automate your day-to-day routine). We built an MCP server and used its capabilities with existing clients like MCP Inspector or Claude Desktop.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, we want to use those tools directly in our AI applications. To do that, let’s build our own MCP client. We will write fairly low-level code, which will also give you a clearer picture of how tools like Claude Code interact with MCP under the hood.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, I would like to implement the feature that is currently (*July 2025*) missing from Claude Desktop: the ability for the LLM to automatically check whether it has a suitable prompt template for the task at hand and use it. Right now, you have to pick the template manually, which isn’t very convenient.\n",
      "\n",
      "As a bonus, I will also share a high-level implementation using the smolagents framework, which is ideal for scenarios when you work only with MCP tools and don’t need much customisation.\n",

      "\n",
      "## 1. **Model Context Protocol (MCP) - Standardization of AI Integrations**\n",
      "The article centers on MCP, Anthropic's protocol for standardizing how LLMs interact with external tools and data sources. This represents a shift toward reducing integration complexity from N×M to N+M connections, enabling reusable, community-built servers and promoting interoperability across AI applications.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 2. **Client-Server Architecture for AI Applications**\n",
      "The article demonstrates the three-component MCP architecture:\n",
      "- **Host** (user-facing application)\n",
      "- **MCP Client** (connection layer)\n",
      "- **MCP Server** (exposes tools, prompts, and resources)\n",
      "\n",
      "This pattern represents an emerging trend of modular, protocol-based AI system design rather than monolithic applications.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 3. **Autonomous Tool Selection and Dynamic Prompt Templates**\n",
      "A notable feature discussed is automatic prompt template selection—enabling the LLM to independently determine and apply appropriate prompt templates for tasks, rather than requiring manual user selection. This reflects the broader trend toward more autonomous AI agents.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 4. **Low-Level AI Agent Implementation vs. High-Level Frameworks**\n",
      "The article contrasts building custom MCP clients from scratch (for understanding and customization) with using frameworks like **smolagents** for rapid development when working exclusively with MCP tools. This highlights the maturation of the agentic AI ecosystem with multiple abstraction levels.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 5. **Multi-Tool Integration for AI Agents**\n",
      "The practical implementation connects to multiple specialized MCP servers (analytics toolkit, filesystem, web fetch), demonstrating the trend toward AI agents that orchestrate multiple specialized tools rather than single-purpose applications.\u001b[0m\n",

      "# Key AI Trends and Concepts from the Article\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on this 2025 article, here are the main AI trends and concepts discussed:\n",
      "\n",
      "## 1. **Agentic AI and Reflection Design Pattern**\n",
      "The core focus is on **reflection** as a fundamental agentic design pattern where LLMs iteratively review and improve their outputs through feedback loops, mimicking human work processes. This enables AI agents to self-critique and refine results rather than generating responses in a single pass.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 2. **Building AI Systems from First Principles**\n",
      "A trend toward understanding AI tools \"from scratch\" rather than relying solely on high-level frameworks. The article advocates working directly with foundation model APIs to gain deeper understanding of how agentic systems actually work.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 3. **Self-Correction and Iterative Refinement Techniques**\n",
      "Key methodologies cited include:\n",
      "- **Self-Refine** (self-feedback loops)\n",
      "- **Reflexion** (verbal reinforcement learning)\n",
      "- **CRITIC** (tool-interactive critiquing with external feedback)\n",
      "- **ReAct** (combining reasoning and acting)\n",
      "\n",
      "These approaches show 10-30% performance improvements across diverse tasks.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 4. **Popular Agentic AI Frameworks**\n",
      "Mentioned tools and frameworks include: GitHub Copilot, Claude Desktop, OpenAI Operator, Perplexity Comet, CrewAI, smolagents, DSPy, and LangGraph.\n",
      "\n",

      "--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "# Key AI Trends and Concepts from the Article\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on this 2025 article, here are the main AI trends and concepts discussed:\n",
      "\n",
      "## 1. **Agentic AI and Reflection Design Pattern**\n",
      "The core focus is on **reflection** as a fundamental agentic design pattern where LLMs iteratively review and improve their outputs through feedback loops, mimicking human work processes. This enables AI agents to self-critique and refine results rather than generating responses in a single pass.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 2. **Building AI Systems from First Principles**\n",
      "A trend toward understanding AI tools \"from scratch\" rather than relying solely on high-level frameworks. The article advocates working directly with foundation model APIs to gain deeper understanding of how agentic systems actually work.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 3. **Self-Correction and Iterative Refinement Techniques**\n",
      "Key methodologies cited include:\n",
      "- **Self-Refine** (self-feedback loops)\n",
      "- **Reflexion** (verbal reinforcement learning)\n",
      "- **CRITIC** (tool-interactive critiquing with external feedback)\n",
      "- **ReAct** (combining reasoning and acting)\n",
      "\n",
      "These approaches show 10-30% performance improvements across diverse tasks.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 4. **Popular Agentic AI Frameworks**\n",
      "Mentioned tools and frameworks include: GitHub Copilot, Claude Desktop, OpenAI Operator, Perplexity Comet, CrewAI, smolagents, DSPy, and LangGraph.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 5. **Production Trade-offs: Quality vs. Cost/Latency**\n",
      "Recognition that reflection's quality improvements must be balanced against increased API calls, latency, and costs—a key consideration for real-world business applications.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Beyond Prompting: The Power of Context Engineering\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "# Key AI Trends and Concepts from the Article\n",
      "\n",
      "## 1. **Context Engineering as a Discipline**\n",
      "A systematic approach to optimizing what information goes into an LLM's prompt, positioning itself as a cost-effective alternative to fine-tuning. Focuses on making \"self-improving\" systems that learn from experience without retraining model parameters.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 2. **Evolution from Static to Self-Improving Contexts**\n",
      "Progression through three stages:\n",
      "- **Static prompting** (hand-crafted, fixed instructions)\n",
      "- **Dynamic retrieval** (RAG - Retrieval-Augmented Generation)\n",
      "- **Self-improving contexts** (adaptive systems that update based on past performance)\n",
      "\n",
      "## 3. **Agentic Context Engineering (ACE) Framework**\n",
      "A novel 2025 approach that addresses \"brevity bias\" and \"context collapse\" through:\n",
      "- Structured \"playbook\" of reusable knowledge bullets with metadata\n",
      "- Three-component loop: Generator → Reflector → Curator\n",
      "- Incremental delta updates rather than full prompt rewrites\n",
      "- 83.6% lower token costs with +10.6% performance improvement on benchmarks\n",
      "\n",
      "## 4. **Natural Language-Based Learning Methods**\n",
      "Emergence of frameworks using verbal/textual feedback instead of gradient-based updates:\n",
      "- **Reflexion** - learning through natural language reflection\n",
      "- **TextGrad** - \"backpropagation\" using textual critiques\n",
      "- **GEPA** - evolutionary algorithms with prompt mutation and selection\n",
      "\n",
      "## 5. **Test-Time Learning and Adaptive Memory**\n",
      "Systems that accumulate and reuse knowledge during inference without explicit retraining, enabling continuous improvement through persistent memory mechanisms.\n",
      "\n",

      "## 1. **LLM Agents and Agentic AI**\n",
      "The article introduces **LLM agents** as a paradigm shift from predefined workflows to autonomous reasoning systems. Instead of hardcoding every step, agents use LLMs as a \"reasoning engine\" to dynamically choose actions and determine when to return final answers—mirroring how human analysts work.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 2. **Tool-Using LLMs (Function Calling)**\n",
      "The article focuses on **OpenAI function calling** as a critical capability that allows LLMs to interact with external systems. This enables LLMs to invoke tools like SQL executors, calculators, or search engines, bridging the gap between language models and real-world data systems.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 3. **Structured Output via Function Calling**\n",
      "Two key use cases for functions are highlighted:\n",
      "- **Tagging & Extraction**: Using function calls to ensure structured, validated output formats instead of unstructured text\n",
      "- **Tools & Routing**: Enabling agent-like behavior where LLMs can select and execute appropriate tools\n",

      "This pattern represents an emerging trend of modular, protocol-based AI system design rather than monolithic applications.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 3. **Autonomous Tool Selection and Dynamic Prompt Templates**\n",
      "A notable feature discussed is automatic prompt template selection—enabling the LLM to independently determine and apply appropriate prompt templates for tasks, rather than requiring manual user selection. This reflects the broader trend toward more autonomous AI agents.\n",

      "## 2. **Framework Interoperability and Integration**\n",
      "Rather than being another standalone framework, NAT acts as \"glue\" that integrates with existing popular frameworks (LangGraph, LangChain, CrewAI, LlamaIndex, DSPy), highlighting a trend toward composable, multi-framework AI architectures.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 3. **Agentic AI with Tool Use**\n",
      "The article demonstrates the evolution from simple chat completion to tool-equipped agents that can access and analyze real data, representing the broader shift toward functional agents that can take actions rather than just generate text.\n",
