Tools like GitHub Copilot, Claude Desktop, OpenAI Operator, and Perplexity Comet are automating everyday tasks that would’ve seemed impossible to automate just five years ago. What’s even more remarkable is that with just a few lines of code, we can build our own sophisticated AI tools: ones that search through files, browse the web, click links, and even make purchases. It really does feel like magic.\n",

I find it exciting (and often helpful) to understand how things are actually built and what’s happening under the hood. That’s why I’ve decided to share a series of posts on agentic AI design concepts that’ll help you understand how all these magical tools actually work.\n",

      "To gain a deep understanding, we’ll build a multi-AI agent system from scratch. We’ll avoid using frameworks like CrewAI or smolagents and instead work directly with the foundation model API. Along the way, we’ll explore the fundamental agentic design patterns: reflection, tool use, planning, and multi-agent setups. Then, we’ll combine all this knowledge to build a multi-AI agent system that can answer complex data-related questions.\n",

Tools like GitHub Copilot, Claude Desktop, OpenAI Operator, and Perplexity Comet are automating everyday tasks that would’ve seemed impossible to automate just five years ago.

Tools like GitHub Copilot, Claude Desktop, OpenAI Operator, and Perplexity Comet are automating everyday tasks that would’ve seemed impossible to automate just five years ago.

      "\n",
      "## 1. **Agentic AI Takes Center Stage**\n",
      "The shift from simple chatbots to autonomous AI agents is a dominant theme. Multiple articles focus on \"agentic AI\" and \"code agents,\" indicating that AI systems are evolving from responsive tools to proactive agents that can plan, execute complex tasks, and operate with greater autonomy.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 2. **Beyond Simple Prompting: Programmatic AI Development**\n",
      "There's a clear movement away from traditional prompt engineering toward more sophisticated approaches:\n",
      "- **Context Engineering** - Moving beyond basic prompts to sophisticated context management\n",
      "- **DSPy and Programming Paradigms** - \"Programming, Not Prompting\" suggests treating AI development more like traditional software engineering\n",
      "- The emphasis is on structured, programmatic approaches rather than trial-and-error prompting\n",
      "\n",
      "## 3. **Production-Ready LLM Systems**\n",
      "A strong focus on operationalizing AI:\n",
      "- **LLM Evaluations** moving from prototype to production\n",
      "- **Production-ready frameworks** (NeMo Agent Toolkit featured prominently)\n",
      "- **Monitoring systems** that actually work in production environments\n",
      "- The maturation from experimental AI to enterprise-grade deployments\n",
      "\n",
      "## 4. **Specialized AI Toolkits and Frameworks**\n",
      "The emergence of purpose-built tools:\n",
      "- **NeMo Agent Toolkit** (mentioned in multiple articles)\n",
      "- **MCP (Model Context Protocol)** for chatbot development\n",
      "- **DSPy** for programmatic LLM development\n",
      "- Indicates the ecosystem is maturing with specialized frameworks\n",
      "\n",
      "## 5. **AI for Business Intelligence and Analytics**\n",
      "AI is being applied specifically to business analysis:\n",
      "- **KPI narrative generation** - AI agents that explain metric changes\n",
      "- **Analytics automation** - Personal analytics toolboxes\n",
      "- **Data-to-stories** - Converting raw data into actionable narratives\n",
      "- AI as a business analysis partner, not just a general assistant\n",
      "\n",
      "## 6. **Agent Communication and Interoperability**\n",
      "- **ACP (Agent Communication Protocol)** suggests agents are now expected to communicate with each other\n",
      "- Focus on standardized protocols for multi-agent systems\n",
      "- Moving toward ecosystems of collaborating AI agents\n",
      "\n",
      "## 7. **Reflection and Self-Improvement in AI**\n",
      "\"Agentic AI from First Principles: Reflection\" indicates that AI systems are gaining meta-cognitive capabilities - the ability to reflect on their own performance and improve through self-assessment.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 8. **Emphasis on Measurement and Evaluation**\n",
      "A mature approach to AI quality:\n",
      "- \"Measuring What Matters\"\n",
      "- \"The Next Frontier in LLM Accuracy\"\n",

Tools like GitHub Copilot, Claude Desktop, OpenAI Operator, and Perplexity Comet are automating everyday tasks that would’ve seemed impossible to automate just five years ago. What’s even more remarkable is that with just a few lines of code, we can build our own sophisticated AI tools: ones that search through files, browse the web, click links, and even make purchases. It really does feel like magic.\n",

I find it exciting (and often helpful) to understand how things are actually built and what’s happening under the hood. That’s why I’ve decided to share a series of posts on agentic AI design concepts that’ll help you understand how all these magical tools actually work.\n",

Along the way, we’ll explore the fundamental agentic design patterns: reflection, tool use, planning, and multi-agent setups. Then, we’ll combine all this knowledge to build a multi-AI agent system that can answer complex data-related questions.\n",

      "## 1. **Agentic AI Takes Center Stage**\n",
      "The shift from simple chatbots to autonomous AI agents is a dominant theme. Multiple articles focus on \"agentic AI\" and \"code agents,\" indicating that AI systems are evolving from responsive tools to proactive agents that can plan, execute complex tasks, and operate with greater autonomy.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 2. **Beyond Simple Prompting: Programmatic AI Development**\n",
      "There's a clear movement away from traditional prompt engineering toward more sophisticated approaches:\n",
      "- **Context Engineering** - Moving beyond basic prompts to sophisticated context management\n",
      "- **DSPy and Programming Paradigms** - \"Programming, Not Prompting\" suggests treating AI development more like traditional software engineering\n",
      "- The emphasis is on structured, programmatic approaches rather than trial-and-error prompting\n",
      "\n",
      "## 3. **Production-Ready LLM Systems**\n",
      "A strong focus on operationalizing AI:\n",
      "- **LLM Evaluations** moving from prototype to production\n",
      "- **Production-ready frameworks** (NeMo Agent Toolkit featured prominently)\n",
      "- **Monitoring systems** that actually work in production environments\n",
      "- The maturation from experimental AI to enterprise-grade deployments\n",
      "\n",
      "## 4. **Specialized AI Toolkits and Frameworks**\n",
      "The emergence of purpose-built tools:\n",
      "- **NeMo Agent Toolkit** (mentioned in multiple articles)\n",
      "- **MCP (Model Context Protocol)** for chatbot development\n",
      "- **DSPy** for programmatic LLM development\n",
      "- Indicates the ecosystem is maturing with specialized frameworks\n",
      "\n",
      "## 5. **AI for Business Intelligence and Analytics**\n",
      "AI is being applied specifically to business analysis:\n",
      "- **KPI narrative generation** - AI agents that explain metric changes\n",
      "- **Analytics automation** - Personal analytics toolboxes\n",
      "- **Data-to-stories** - Converting raw data into actionable narratives\n",
      "- AI as a business analysis partner, not just a general assistant\n",
      "\n",
      "## 6. **Agent Communication and Interoperability**\n",
      "- **ACP (Agent Communication Protocol)** suggests agents are now expected to communicate with each other\n",
      "- Focus on standardized protocols for multi-agent systems\n",
      "- Moving toward ecosystems of collaborating AI agents\n",
